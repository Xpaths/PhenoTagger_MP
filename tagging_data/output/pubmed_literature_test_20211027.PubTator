34444952|t|Administration of Lactobacillus reuteri Combined with Clostridium butyricum Attenuates Cisplatin-Induced Renal Damage by Gut Microbiota Reconstitution, Increasing Butyric Acid Production, and Suppressing Renal Inflammation
34444952|a|Anorexia and loss of body weight were major clinical adverse effects during therapy with cisplatin [2,28]. We recorded the changes of food intake and body weight daily to investigate the benefit of LCs on appetite and body weight gain. The levels of food intake, body weight, feeding efficiency ratio (FER), and gastric emptying index in the cisplatin group were significantly lower than that in the control group, whereas the value of gastric contents was significantly higher than that in the control group. Compared with the cisplatin group, these changes of digestive parameters were significantly reversed by LCs administration (Supplementary Figure S1A-E). These results indicated that LCs attenuated cisplatin-induced gastrointestinal toxicity in rats. LCs administration alone did not alter body weight, food intake, or gastrointestinal function during the experimental period. The ratio of kidney/body weight in the cisplatin group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05), but it significantly decreased after supplementation with LCs. The ratio of liver/body weight in the Cis+LCs and LCs groups was significantly lower than that in the cisplatin group, whereas the ratio of stomach/body weight in the Cis+LCs group was significantly higher than that in the cisplatin group (Supplementary Table S1). Apart from creatinine and BUN (traditional markers of kidney function), the elevated cystatin C concentration was considered as an indicator of renal functional impairment [29]. The levels of creatinine, BUN, Cystatin C, IgA, and IS in the cisplatin group were significantly higher than that in control group, whereas the value of uric acid was significantly lower than that in the control group. Compared with the cisplatin group, these changes in blood biochemistry indexes were significantly reversed by LCs administration (Table 1). LCs alone treatment did not alter kidney function markers. The levels of AST were not significantly different among the four groups. In particular, ALT concentration was markedly lower in the Cis +LCs group and LCs group than that in the cisplatin group. The kidney function was restored by LCs. Next, we investigated the effect of LCs on cisplatin-induced histological damages using H&E staining. The morphological analyses of the kidney sections showed that cisplatin-treated rats exhibited a severe histological injury such as tubule dilatation, cast formation, inflammatory cell infiltration, renal interstitial fibrosis, and renal tubular swollenness (Figure 1A). The kidney tissue morphology damages caused by cisplatin were attenuated by LCs. The highest kidney injury score was found in cisplatin-treated rats and was evidently improved after LCs intervention (Figure 1B) (p < 0.05), suggesting that LCs could prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. In general, during MT staining, collagen accumulated around renal tubules appeared light blue, which was considered as a hallmark of tissue fibrosis [30]. In our study, Figure 2 shows that the rats multiple-injected with 5 mg/kg of cisplatin once a week for four times showed significant tubulointerstitial fibrosis of the kidney sections, which was consistent with published results by Li et al. [30]. Loss of basement membranes (abundant cytoplasmic mucopolysaccharides) after cisplatin treatment was observed by PAS staining in renal tubular epithelial cells. The above-mentioned histopathological changes were reversed by LCs administration in cisplatin-treated rats. LCs pre-administration was effective in preventing the progression of renal fibrosis. Compared with the control group, the MDA contents increased, and catalase and GPx activity decreased because of cisplatin treatment, whereas only MDA levels were significantly decreased by LCs supplementation. Catalase and GPx activity were slightly restored, but they were not statistically significant after LCs intervention (Supplementary Figure S2A-C). MPO levels were considered as an indicator of neutrophil infiltration into tissues [31]. Cisplatin resulted in increased MPO levels in kidney tissue and serum (p < 0.05; Figure 2A,B), which were remarkably declined through supplementation with LCs. Rats treated with cisplatin exhibited a decrease in IL-10 content in kidney tissue as compared with the control group, which was slightly increased when they were fed with LCs, but the increase was not statistically significant (Figure 2C). As shown in Figure 3A, cisplatin alone treatment markedly increased the density of F4/80-expressing cells, suggesting increased infiltration of macrophages. However, LCs co-administration after cisplatin treatment reduced F4/80 protein expression, which indicated that LCs could prevent macrophage infiltration. Caspase-3-positive apoptotic cells (indicated by arrows) were increased in the kidney after cisplatin treatment and were greatly attenuated by LCs administration (Figure 3B). KIM-1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which is normally undetectable in the normal kidney but thoroughly expressed in proximal tubule cells after toxicant injury. Figure 3E shows that treatment with cisplatin also significantly increased kidney KIM-1 expression in comparison with control animals. Administration of LCs reduced the protein level of KIM-1 in the damaged kidney. We further evaluated some molecular and histological markers of fibrosis to understand the antifibrotic effects of LCs in tubule injury. Hydroxyproline may be a potential marker of nephrotoxicity related to fibrosis following dosing with cisplatin [32]. We also found that the high values of kidney hydroxyproline in rats treated with cisplatin were consistent with the occurrence of fibrosis and renal tubule necrosis noted in the histopathological results (Figure 3C). Meanwhile, quantification of collagen IV-area fraction showed higher expression values of collagen IV-positive cells in cisplatin treatment groups compared with the control group (Figure 3D). Further analysis using Western blot demonstrated significantly higher expression of fibronectin, β-catenin, and α-SMA protein in the kidney of the cisplatin treatment group compared with the control group. Meanwhile, an improved histological fibrosis was exhibited in the LCs supplementation group, which had a low level of inflammation cell infiltration, collagen IV-positive cells, and expression of fibronectin, β-catenin, and α-SMA protein in kidney tissues as compared with the cisplatin group (Figure 3E). Therefore, LCs administration could reduce cisplatin-induced fibrosis. We have previously shown that the amounts of stool were significantly decreased, and the appearance of cecum contents was watery in cisplatin-treated rats [5]. Supplementary Table S2 shows that the total amounts of stool in the cisplatin group were significantly reduced compared with the other three groups, which were significantly increased when they were fed with LCs (p < 0.05). In addition, no significant change in the amounts of stool was observed between the LCs alone group and control group. Especially, highest levels of the stool moisture content were observed in the LCs alone group among four groups. No significant differences in the stool moisture content and pH value were observed among the experimental groups (p < 0.05). We also observed that the cecum contents of rats treated with cisplatin were watery, but soft stools were observed in rats treated with cisplatin after LCs intervention, and a higher proportion of formed and hard stools was found in the control and LCs groups. Intestinal tissues (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) were examined for histopathology by H&E to observe whether LCs have protective effects against cisplatin-induced mucositis. The normal histology of the small intestine in the control group was characterized by villi which were finger-like and intact, with intact crypt architecture, regular epithelial cells, and mucosal integrity. By contrast, cisplatin caused significant histological changes in ileum segments, and this damage involved shortened villi, loss of crypt architecture, and a pronounced inflammatory cell infiltrate in the lamina propria (Figure 4A-D). Apparently, the H&E-stained section of the ileum from the LCs-pretreated group showed prominent improvement as compared with the cisplatin-treated rats. Research has shown that the length of the colon decreased with inflammation. Hence, colon length could be used as an indicator of inflammation [21]. As shown in Figure 4E,F, the length of the colon in the cisplatin group was significantly shorter than that in the control group, whereas the LCs-pretreated group significantly prevented the decrease in the colon length as compared with the cisplatin group (p < 0.05). In addition, no significant differences in colon length were observed between the LCs alone group and control group. Furthermore, we observed that in the control and LCs alone treatment groups, most villus goblet cells were normal integrated goblet cells with a round-to-oval shape. The cytoplasm was filled with PAS-positive mucous granules. By contrast, rats treated with cisplatin showed that intervillous spaces contained a large amount of discharged mucins. Cisplatin treatment caused depletion of mucous granules from many villus goblet cells, which was a sign of cavitation. In rats pretreated with LCs prior to cisplatin treatment, the number of cavitated goblet cells decreased, and the discharged mucins decreased (Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 5B, the concentration of serum endotoxin in the cisplatin group was significantly elevated compared with the control group, which decreased with LCs supplementation (p < 0.05). Gut permeability was evaluated by TJ proteins ZO-1. The results showed that the intestinal ZO-1 mRNA expression of cisplatin-treated rats significantly decreased compared with the control rats, but the decrease was markedly recovered by LCs supplementation (Figure 5C; p < 0.05). No significant difference in serum endotoxin levels and ZO-1 mRNA expression was observed between the LCs alone treatment group and control group. The mucosal integrity was impaired, and the activities of intestinal digestive enzymes in the BBM (such as sucrase, maltase, leucine amino enzyme, and lipase) significantly decreased in rats treated with cisplatin, which led to a significant reduction in intestinal function [33]. The activity of the intestinal digestive enzymes was measured to evaluate digestive function. We observed that cisplatin l reduced lipase activity compared with the control group (Figure 6D), whereas supplementation of LCs in cisplatin-treated rats significantly improved the activities of sucrase and maltase as compared with cisplatin-treated rats (p < 0.05; Figure 6A,B). On the contrary, the activities of sucrase and maltase were markedly increased in rats fed with LCs as compared with the normal rats. However, LAP digestive enzyme activity did not show any significant difference among the four groups (Figure 6C). We further investigated whether LCs’s protection could involve modulation of the SCFAs. In fecal samples, the levels of n-butyrate significantly declined in cisplatin-treated rats compared with the control group, and such levels were restored by LCs supplementation. In addition, among the four groups, the levels of acetate, propionate, and n-butyrate were highest in the LCs alone treatment group (Figure 7). Evidence shows that cisplatin can cause a severe compositional and functional disturbance in the gut microbial community [1,2]. Next, NGS-16S analysis in feces of cecum was performed to investigate whether the reconstruction of gut microbiota induced by “good” bacteria could prevent kidney damage after cisplatin administration. At the phylum level (Figure 8A), compared with the control group, a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes and a higher abundance of Firmicutes were observed in cisplatin-treated rats, which resulted in an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio in the cisplatin treatment group (Figure 8C). However, the cisplatin and LCs combined therapy did not significantly affect the F/B ratio. The richness, diversity, and evenness of gut microbiota were expressed by Chao1 and Shannon indices among the four groups (Figure 8D). The values of Chao1 and Shannon in the cisplatin group were lower than those of the control group, whereas higher values in alpha diversity indices were observed in the Cis+LCs group, compared with the cisplatin group. The Chao1 and Shannon indices were lowest in the LCs alone treatment group. These findings suggested that LCs intervention could reverse the ecological diversity and richness of gut microbiota in cisplatin-treated rats. Weighted UniFrac distance approach was used to compare the similarity of the gut microbial communities (β diversity) and the global composition of the microbiota among the groups. Figure 8C also shows the average weighted UniFrac distances. The smaller the value, the smaller the difference in species diversity among the samples. The average weighted UniFrac distances were decreased by LCs administration in cisplatin-treated rats, indicating that the microbiota of Cis+LCs rats were more similar to one another when compared with cisplatin-treated rats. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) result of principal component analysis based on the OTU level is shown in Figure 8E, and all samples in the four groups can be clearly distinguished. The cisplatin and Cis+LCs groups can be clearly separated, indicating that the intervention of LCs significantly altered the composition of microbial communities in cisplatin-treated rats. We also found that the composition of microbial communities between the control group and LCs alone group was similar. The PCoA plots showed that the closer the distance among the samples, the more similar the species composition structure; therefore, these microbiota will cluster together. As shown in Figure 8F, PCoA plots revealed that the rats fed with LCs alone had a similar gut bacterial composition with small intra-group variation, but the rats treated with cisplatin and co-treated with LCs exhibited greater intra-group variations. The LEfSe algorithm was used to identify microbes as potential biomarkers at multiple taxonomical levels, which characterized the differences among these four groups within the digestive tract, and to identify taxonomic differences between cisplatin-treated and LCs-supplemented rats. All potential biomarkers (LDA score > 4) are shown in Figure 8G. At the family level, the cisplatin-treated rats showed increased Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae, whereas Ruminococcaceae was enriched in LCs-supplemented rats. At the genus level, Escherichia-Shigella was the dominant bacteria in cisplatin-treated rats, whereas the biomarkers in cisplatin-treated rats fed with LCs were Ruminiciostridium_9 and Oscillibacter. These data demonstrated that cisplatin increased the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia-Shigella and Enterobacteriaceae, which was thoroughly reversed by LCs supplementation. Notably, the dominant bacteria in LCs alone treatment group were primarily Muribaculaceae. We used metagenomeSeq to identify taxa that showed statistically significant genera or species levels at different treatment groups (Figure 8H). Escherichia-Shigella and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 609 were highest within the gastrointestinal tract of rats treated with cisplatin compared with other treatment groups, and this increase was reversed by the supplementation of LCs. By contrast, we observed that cisplatin reduced the amount of Muribaculaceae and Roseburia compared with the control group, whereas supplementation of LCs in cisplatin-treated rats significantly increased both bacteria. Notably, the amounts of Bifidobacterium in the Cis+LCs group were highest among the four groups.

33396195|t|Melittin Increases Cisplatin Sensitivity and Kills KM-H2 and L-428 Hodgkin Lymphoma Cells
33396195|a|We observed high toxicity of MEL for HL cell lines KM-H2 and L-428. IC50 values were found to be 0.93 +/− 0.42 µM for L-428 cells and 0.75 +/− 0.073 µM for KM-H2 cells (see Supplementary Figure S1). The toxicity of MEL for these HL cells was higher than the toxicity for normal blood cells. We co-cultured KM-H2 or L-428 cells with normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the presence of different concentrations of MEL. HL cells and PBMC were discriminated using their different cell size. As shown in Figure 1, the percentage of living tumor cells decreased with increasing MEL concentrations. Interestingly, we observed a shift in the composition of the surviving normal PBMCs. As shown in Figure 2 we observed a strong increase in the monocyte population. This increase was also visible in cultures without HL cells. After staining with specific antibodies, we observed a strong increase in the percentage of CD14-positive monocytes and a less pronounced but significant increase in the percentage of CD56-positive NK cells (Figure 3). Percentages of CD19-positive B cells and CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells decreased whereas CD4-positive T helper cells remained unchanged. We asked whether the combination of MEL with cytotoxic drugs could enhance the drug sensitivity of resistant HL cells. Therefore, we pre-incubated L-428 cells with a low concentration of MEL and tested sensitivity for cisplatin. As shown in Figure 4, MEL pre-treated L-428 cells showed significantly enhanced sensitivity for cisplatin. In KM-H2 cells, which have a higher basal sensitivity for cisplatin (see Supplementary Figure S2), only marginal effects were observed (Figure 4). Recently it was shown that a MEL analog can inhibit expression of the multidrug resistance ABC transporter ABCB1 [48]. ABCB1 activity can be measured by quantification of efflux of the dye Rhodamin-123 (Rh123). We observed higher ABCB1 transporter activity in the chemo-resistant HL cell line L-428. Interestingly, KM-H2 cells showed two populations of cells with different Rh123 efflux activity (Figure 5). We sorted these cells by flow cytometry. DNA microarray analysis indicated that KM-H2 cells with high Rh123 efflux capacity had higher expression of ABCB1 (Figure 6). We asked whether ABCB1 activity influences drug sensitivity in HL cell lines. After incubation of KM-H2 cells with cisplatin, we observed no selective depletion of Rh123 high cells (Figure 7). In addition, we observed no increased Rh123 efflux in L-428 cells after treatment with MEL (Figure 8). These observations suggest that ABCB1 transporter activity plays no major role in the drug sensitivity of these cells. Accordingly, ABC transporters were not among the top genes that we identified in our previous gene expression profiling studies as resistance-associated genes [50].

34266386|t|MitoTox: a comprehensive mitochondrial toxicity database
34266386|a|To better understand the physiological impact of each drug or compound on mitochondria, we constructed a drug database combining general pharmaceutical information and experimental data on the drugs. We searched for mitochondria-related keywords in the complete DrugBank file and found 1011 items that were possibly related to drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity. Through manual curation, we identified 180 true positive items of drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity. We applied the same pipeline to obtain drug targets, synonym names, and clinical information for these drugs. From the keyword search in PubMed, over 300 review articles and research papers reporting drugs and molecules were manually recorded in the MitoTox database. Collectively, our database currently contains 1400 drugs or compounds that have been tested for or show evidence of mitochondrial toxicity, which are classified into 77 categories of mitochondrial toxicity mechanisms (Fig 3). Mitochondrial dysfunction could stem from structural, enzymatic, and biochemical changes [28]. Mitochondrial toxicities arise from different mechanisms, including interference with the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and mitochondrial DNA replication, leading to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased mitochondrial oxidative stress, and eventually cell death. Based on these results, mitochondrial toxicity mechanisms are classified into eight main categories: alternation of transmembrane potential, function of mitochondria, organization of mitochondria, movement of mitochondria, oxidative stress, cell death, mitochondrial DNA, and metabolic-related signaling pathways (Fig 4a). Each category is further classified into subgroups according to the corresponding toxicity mechanism. For example, in the category of transmembrane potential, inhibiting ETC or uncoupling or modulating transport of ions could be mechanisms that affect mitochondrial membrane potential and therefore were classified under the mitochondrial membrane potential category. Mitochondrial toxicity-related targets are classified into mitochondrial enzymes in the matrix, transporters or carriers on the membranes, mitochondrial DNA replication machinery, RNAs, protein synthesis and assembly machinery, small molecules and metabolites, etc. The targets can also be classified based on their locations, such as the mitochondrial matrix, inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and intermembrane space (IMS). In each category, there are molecular targets corresponding to altering mitochondrial function and morphology. For example, in the ETC category, there are complex I, complex II, complex III, complex IV, and ATP synthase proteins. In each protein complex, there are multiple subunits or molecules that could be the targets for an individual drug. Each molecular target is recorded in the database with relevant molecular entries, such as molecular protein name and gene name, EC number, subcellular location, involved reactions, and modulators (Fig 4b). The drugs that target mitochondria can affect multiple factors to induce mitochondrial toxicity [29]. Therefore, drug targets related to mitochondria and related metabolism or signaling pathways are cross-referenced and linked by toxin-target associations based on multiple experimental data from the literature and databases. Common screening assays for mitochondrial toxicity include evaluation of cytotoxicity of the compounds incubated with cultured cells in glucose or galactose conditioned media (Glu/Gal assay) [30], and measurements of mitochondrial oxygen consumption [31, 32], mitochondrial membrane potential [33, 34], reactive oxygen species [31, 32], mitochondrial permeability transition [35], and cellular ATP content [21, 36, 37]. Many of these mitochondrial functional assays have been applied to high-throughput screening for mitochondrial toxicity [38]. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) is determined by a balance between the proton gradient and other ion gradients across the inner mitochondrial membrane maintained by proton pumps and electrogenic ion channels or transporters. Since mitochondrial membrane potential is a part of the proton-motive force that generates ATP, ΔΨm is an important indicator of mitochondrial function and cell health. Lipophilic cationic compounds (such as TMRM, TMRE, and JC1) accumulating in the mitochondrial membrane matrix space are often used to monitor ΔΨm in high-throughput screening assays. Oxygen consumption profile is another important indicator of mitochondrial function. Microplate-based assays using oxygen-sensitive fluorescent probes provide a means for high-throughput evaluation of oxygen consumption rate (OCR), reserve capacity, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Drugs or compounds that significantly change the mitochondrial membrane potential and OCR profiles are included in the MitoTox database and are labeled as positive or negative entries in the assay results based on the experimental criteria. The experimental systems and conditions, including the dosage, exposure time, substrates, or growth conditions, are also recorded along with their corresponding references (Fig 5).

33578912|t|Suppressed Hepatic Production of Indoxyl Sulfate Attenuates Cisplatin-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Sulfotransferase 1a1-Deficient Mice
33578912|a|Cisplatin treatment resulted in marked increases in serum IS levels in WT mice, whereas this increase was significantly suppressed in Sult1a1^-/- (KO) mice (Figure 1). These results indicated that hepatic SULT1A1 was involved in the production and accumulation of IS during cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Cisplatin treatment caused a considerable increase in the levels of BUN and serum creatinine in WT mice (Figure 2a,b), but they were significantly attenuated in Sult1a1^-/- (KO) mice. Figure 2c shows histological alterations in the kidney of WT and Sult1a1^-/- (KO) mice after cisplatin treatment. In WT mice, cisplatin caused severe histological tubular injuries with the formation of casts derived from sloughed cells, cellular debris, tubular dilation with widening of the lumen, and atrophy of the tubular epithelium. However, tubular injuries caused by cisplatin treatment were markedly attenuated in Sult1a1^-/- (KO) mice. We examined renal apoptosis by TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) staining. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the kidney was counted. Cisplatin treatment markedly increased the number of apoptotic cells in the kidneys of WT mice, but the apoptosis was significantly suppressed in the kidneys of Sult1a1^-/- (KO) mice (Figure 3). Next, we examined the effects of cisplatin treatment on the expression of various factors associated with inflammation and oxidative stress in the kidney. The mRNA expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) showed a tendency to be elevated in cisplatin-treated WT mice, and this effect was suppressed in Sult1a1^-/- (KO) mice but the difference was not significant (Figure 4a). IS has been reported to directly activate AhR and to generate oxidative stress through NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [17]. AhR expression tended to increase in the kidney of both WT mice and Sult1a1^-/- (KO) mice treated with cisplatin (Figure 4b). A similar expression profile was observed for xanthine oxidase (XO) (Figure 4c). Cisplatin treatment increased the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and quinone oxidoreductase (NQO)-1, both of which are downstream factors of the oxidative stress responsive transcription factor Nrf2 (Figure 4d,e). NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) was suppressed by cisplatin treatment in WT mice, whereas this effect was suppressed in Sult1a1^-/- (KO) mice (Figure 4f). The expressions of superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1, SOD2, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), and catalase (Cat) were decreased by cisplatin treatment in WT mice (Figure 4g-j). The suppressions of SOD1 and GPx1 were partially inhibited in the kidneys of Sult1a1^-/- (KO) mice. These results suggest that IS induces oxidative stress by suppressing antioxidant enzyme expression. In order to further investigate the role of IS in cisplatin-induced AKI, we examined the cytotoxic effect and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production using an immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cell line from normal adult human kidney, HK-2 cells. As shown in Figure 5, HK-2 cells treated with both cisplatin and IS had significantly lower cell viability than the cells treated with IS alone. The in vivo data from this study revealed that antioxidant enzyme expression was decreased in cisplatin-treated mouse kidneys. Next, we investigated the ROS levels in HK-2 cells. ROS levels were increased in HK-2 cells treated with IS (Figure 6). Combination treatment with cisplatin and IS resulted in significant higher ROS levels compared to IS treatment alone. In addition, ROS levels increased in a time-dependent manner. The in vivo data gathered herein suggested that AhR mRNA expression might increase in the kidneys of cisplatin-treated mice. AhR expression was also examined in HK-2 cells. AhR expression decreased in HK-2 cells treated with IS alone (Figure 7). However, when the cells were treated with both cisplatin and IS, this downregulation was less pronounced. Next, we investigated the ROS levels in HK-2 cells transfected with siAhR, siXO, and siNOX4. The ROS levels were decreased in HK-2 cells treated with IS alone (Figure 8). Moreover, the ROS levels in HK-2 cells treated with both cisplatin and IS were also decreased by siAhR, siXO, and siNOX4. This result suggests that AhR, XO, and NOX4 are partly involved in the increase in ROS induced by IS.

33049997|t|PPAR-α Deletion Attenuates Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity by Modulating Renal Organic Transporters MATE-1 and OCT-2
33049997|a|We treated C57BL6 and PPAR-α-deficient mice with a single dose of cisplatin (20 mg/kp i.p). Ninety-six hours after cisplatin (CP) treatment, the wild-type mice showed increased serum creatinine and urea levels, while PPAR-α knockout mice (CP PPARKO) avoided the increase of these parameters (Table 1. Moreover, real-time PCR was performed in the kidney to assess renal injury markers. Cisplatin treatment (CP) upregulated the mRNA levels of NGAL and KIM-1 and PPAR-α ablation (CP PPARKO) attenuated the upregulation of these molecules (Table 1). Several studies have evidenced that inflammation contributes to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity [1,2]. Proinflammatory cytokines are produced mainly by activated macrophages and are tightly involved in augmenting inflammatory reactions [21]. CP exponentially increased renal expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, while CP PPARKO blunted these increases (Figure 1A-C). Cisplatin-induced renal cell death involves several pathways, including apoptosis. We performed qPCR for TNFR-2, which is related to apoptosis extrinsic pathway and Bax/Bcl-2, which is related to apoptosis intrinsic pathway. CP upregulated TNFR-2 and Bax/Bcl-2 in renal tissue and CP PPARKO avoided the upregulation of these apoptosis-related genes (Figure 1D-E). Cisplatin affects the proximal tubules of the kidneys through several mechanisms, including tubular necrosis. In the histological analysis, we observed a large increase of tubular injury in cisplatin-treated mice, while PPAR-α knockout mice showed tubular cells protected against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (Figure 2A-B). Cisplatin administration leads to increased apoptosis in the kidney. Caspase-3 is the main executioner caspase and is activated in the apoptotic cell, by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Immunofluorescence was performed to identify apoptosis in renal tissue. Cisplatin treatment increased caspase-3 in wild-type mice and PPAR-α ablation prevented the increase of this protein (Figure 2B). Organic Transporters, such as OCT-2 and MATE-1, are of great importance in cisplatin nephrotoxicity: the first one is the main transporter of cisplatin into kidney cells, and the second one is responsible for cisplatin extrusion from the kidney into the urine. Cisplatin treatment induced the downregulation of OCT-2 and MATE-1 in the renal tissue, while PPAR-α deletion prevented cisplatin-induced downregulation of MATE-1 (Figure 3A-B) and OCT-2 (Figure 4A-B). Immunofluorescence and real-time PCR were performed to check organic transporters protein and mRNA levels at the basal state. PPAR-α absence did not alter MATE-1 mRNA expression (Figure 5A); however, PPARKO mice showed increased MATE-1 protein levels observed in immunofluorescence (Figure 5B). In addition, organic cations transporter 2 (OCT-2) mRNA expression and protein levels were decreased in PPAR-α knockout mice (Figure 6A,B).
