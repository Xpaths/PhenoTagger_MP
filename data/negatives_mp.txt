A. 1986.tables”) shows the results (mean values) of the blood analysis, table 2b the differential blood count after 1 and 3 months of treatment.This differences were similar but greater in Week 13.- prematurely deceased female rats (pre-mortal symptoms): pilo-erection and/or reduced motility were noted in all or several females.The haemoglobin, erythrocytes and haematocrit values of the males treated with 300 mg/kg bw/day were statistically significant increased between 9 and 10%.NOAEL (rat, 90 days): 300 mg tricobalt tetraoxide/kg bw/day 

Looking at the treatment period the following test item-related changes were noted:
The body weight of the male animals treated with 1000 mg/kg bw/day was slightly reduced by up to 10% compared to the control group as of test day 22.Accordingly, the body weight gain was reduced by up to 17 percentage points in comparison to the control.The body weight at autopsy of the males of 1000 mg/kg bw/day dose group was reduced by 12% on test day 91.Furthermore, the body weight of the female animals treated with 1000 mg/kg bw/day was only marginally reduced by up to 5% compared to the control group as of test day 64.The body weight gain and the body weight at autopsy were similarly only slightly reduced compared to the control group.Overall, the reduced body weights at the 1000 mg/kg bw/day dose are considered as test item-related.Next, repeated oral treatment of male and female rats with 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day led to a few test item-related changes in haematological parameters in comparison to the control animals.Also, in the 1000 mg/kg bw/day dose group the values of haemoglobin, erythrocytes and haematocrit of the males were statistically significant increased (between 23 - 26%) as well as in the females (between 11 - 14%).The platetes were statistically significant decreased (32%) in the males.Following the treatment period, a recovery period followed that was conducted with the control group and the 1000 mg/kg bw/day dose group.No changes related to the previous 1000 mg/kg bw/day treatment with tricobalt tetraoxide were noted at the end of the 4-week recovery period.The slightly reduced body weight of the treated male animals had recovered to a level comparable to the control group at the end of the recovery period.The intensity of the staining increased with the dose level.The slightly increased values of red blood cell-related parameters (haemoglobin content, number of erythrocytes, haematocrit value) and the slightly decreased number of platelets in the previously dosed male and female animals had returned to values comparable to the control group at the end of the recovery period 

Overall, no further test-item related changes were observed.CLINICAL SIGNS AND MORTALITY
1) Treatment period:
- 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day: none of the male and female rats treated orally revealed any test item-related changes in behaviour or external appearance.- 1000 mg/kg bw/day: two female animals revealed an exophthalmus from test day 79 onwards.This is considered to be a coincidental finding that is not test item-related.- the faeces of all test item-treated male and female animals were dark stained from test day 48 onwards for the male animals and from test day 41 onwards for the female animals.The dark staining of the faeces was not recorded before test day 41/48 as only from these time points onwards a clear difference in the colour of the faeces compared to the control animals was evident for all test item-treated animals.The dark staining of the faeces is considered to be related to the black-grey colour of the test item and not to be a toxicological effect.The consistency of all animals' faeces was normal throughout the treatment period.
- no deaths were noted at any dose level. 
- all main study animals survived until their scheduled terminal sacrifice.- detailed clinical observations: none of the animals treated with 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day revealed any test item-related changes in external appearance, body posture, movement and coordination capabilities, or behaviour as assessed in test weeks 1 to 13 (all groups).- detailed clinical observations: all parameters of all animals scheduled for the control or treatment groups were in the normal range at pre-dose examination in test week -1.One male animal treated with 1000 mg/kg b.w./day revealed a haemorrhagic nose in test week 12.Furthermore, one female animal treated with 1000 mg/kg bw/day revealed a movable solid palpable mass with a diameter of approximately 8 to 20 mm near the second mammary gland from test week 9 onwards.Lastly, another female 1000 mg/kg bw/day dose animal revealed areas with thin fur (size approximately 10 mm × 30 mm) on both forelimbs in test weeks 10 to 13.All findings noted are considered as spontaneous changes that are not related to the test item due to the single occurrence in each case.2) Recovery period (restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group)
- 1000 mg/kg bw/day: no abnormalities in behaviour or external appearance were observed for the treated male and female animals during the recovery period.Furthermore, the exophthalmus of the female recovery animal previously treated, that is considered not test item-related, was still present until the end of the recovery period.Lastly, the faeces of the male and female animal previously treated was still dark stained until test day 95.From test day 96 onwards, the dark staining of the faeces had subsided and the colour had returned to normal.The consistency of all animals' faeces was normal throughout the recovery period.
- no deaths were noted during the recovery period.All recovery animals survived until the scheduled recovery sacrifice.- detailed clinical observations: none of the animals treated with 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day revealed any test item-related changes in external appearance, body posture, movement and coordination capabilities, or behaviour as assessed in test weeks 14 to 17 (control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group only).BODY WEIGHT AND WEIGHT GAIN
1) Treatment period
- 100 or 300 mg/kg bw/day: no test item-related changes were noted for the male and female animals.- 1000 mg/kg bw/day (males only): body weight of the male animals was slightly reduced by up to 10% compared to the control group as of test day 22 (p ≤ 0.05 or p ≤ 0.01).The body weight gain was reduced by up to 17 percentage points in comparison to the control.The body weight at autopsy of the male animals was reduced by 12% on test day 91 (p ≤ 0.01).- 1000 mg/kg bw/day (females only): body weight of the female animals was only marginally reduced by up to 5% compared to the control group as of test day 64 (not statistically significant).The body weight gain and the body weight at autopsy were similarly only slightly reduced compared to the control group.- reduced body weights at the 1000 mg/kg bw/day dose are considered as test item-related.2) Recovery period (restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group)
- slight differences in body weight between the animals previously treated with 1000 mg/kg bw/day and the control group had nearly completely subsided at the end of the treatment period in both the male and female animals. - animals previously treated with the 1000 mg/kg bw/day dose revealed a higher body weight gain than the control group during the recovery period. - no noteworthy difference was noted for the body weight at autopsy between the animals previously treated with the 1000 mg/kg bw/day group dose and the control group at recovery sacrifice.FOOD CONSUMPTION
Treatment and recovery period (recovery restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group):
- 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg b.w./day: no test item-related influence was observed on the food consumption of the male and female animals compared to the control animals throughout the treatment period and the recovery period.- 1000 mg/kg bw/day: food consumption of the male animals appeared to be slightly increased by 5% compared to the control group in test week 5 (period of test days 29 to 36, p ≤ 0.05).This effect is considered to be due to the reduced body weight of these male animals.- test item-treated female animals appeared to reveal a statistically significant (at p ≤ 0.05 or p ≤ 0.01) increase in the food consumption of up to 9% in test weeks 3, 4 and/or 5 at all dose levels.This is considered to be a coincidental effect as the food intake of the female animals was generally slightly higher in all test item-treated groups than in the control group during the first six test weeks, but no dose-response relationship was noted.- statistically significant differences in food consumption compared to the control group that are not considered to be test item-related are as follows: increased relative food consumption
- relatively low food consumption noted for the control and the high dose group in test week 17 of the recovery period (test day 111 to test day 118) is due to the overnight fasting of the animals before urine collection on test day 117.WATER CONSUMPTION
Treatment and recovery period (recovery restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group):
- no test item-related differences between the test item-treated animals and the control animals throughout the treatment and the recovery period.OPHTHALMOSCOPIC EXAMINATION

- no test item-related effects were observed for the number of leucocytes, the relative reticulocyte count, the relative and absolute differential blood count, the thromboplastin time, the activated partial thromboplastin time, the mean corpuscular volume, the mean corpuscular haemoglobin and the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration at the end of the treatment period (test day 91).2) Recovery period (restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group)
- 1000 mg/kg bw/day: all changes in haematological parameters previously observed after repeated treatment had subsided after 4 weeks of recovery (test day 119, day 28 of the 4-week recovery period).
- no test item-related effects were observed on the haemoglobin content, numbers of erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets, relative reticulocyte count, haematocrit value, relative and absolute differential blood count, thromboplastin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration at the end of the recovery period (test day 119).- statistically significant differences in haematological parameters compared to the control animals on test day 91 (end of treatment) or test day 119 (end of recovery) that are not considered to be test item-related are as follows:
Treatment period (1000 mg/kg bw/day):

- Final mean bodyweights of mice that received 1000 or 2000 mg/kg bw/day were 10% lower than that of the vehicle controls for males and 2% lower for females.CLINICAL CHEMISTRY
Treatment and recovery period (recovery restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group):
- 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day: no test item-related influence was noted on the biochemical parameters of the male and female animals at the end of the treatment period and at the end of the recovery period.All data are considered to be within the limits of normal biological variability.- statistically significant changes in biochemical parameters in comparison to the control group listed as follows are considered to be coincidental and not related to the test item: 
Treatment period:
decreased total cholesterol (1000 mg/kg bw/day; males; p ≤ 0.01)
decreased urea (in blood)(100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg bw/day; males; p ≤ 0.05 or p ≤ 0.01)
decreased calcium (1000 mg/kg bw/day; males; p ≤ 0.05)
increased chloride (300 mg/kg bw/day; males; p ≤ 0.05)
increased chloride (300 and 1000 mg/kg bw/day; females; p ≤ 0.01)
increased sodium (1000 mg/kg bw/day; females; p ≤ 0.05)

URINALYSIS
Treatment and recovery period (recovery restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group):
- 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day: daily treatment did not lead to any test item-related changes of the urinary parameters of the male and female animals compared to the control group at the end of the treatment period and at the end of the recovery period.- statistically significant differences in the urinary parameters compared to the control animals on test day 89 or 117 that are not considered to be test item related are as follows:
Treatment period:
increased pH value (1000 mg/kg bw/day; females; p ≤ 0.05)
increased relative urine volume (1000 mg/kg bw/day; females; p ≤ 0.05)

Recovery period:
decreased specific gravity (1000 mg/kg bw/day; females; p ≤ 0.05)

NEUROBEHAVIOUR
Treatment and recovery period (recovery restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group):
- 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day: no test item-related influence was noted on any of the parameters examined during the functional observation tests, on the fore- and hind limb grip strength, or on the spontaneous motility for any of the male and female animals in test week 13 and in test week 17.
- individual male and female animals of the test item-treated and/or control groups revealed a score different from the normal score for the parameters urination, toe pinch, tail pinch, wire maneuver, and/or positive geotropism in test week 13 and/or in test week 17.No general difference in the frequency and degree was noted for these parameters between the test item-treated groups and the control group.All occurrences of scores different from the normal score for the examined parameters are considered to be within the normal range of biological variation.
- the following statistically significant changes in comparison to the control animals observed for numerical neurological parameters in test week 13 or 17 are considered to be coincidental effects and not to be related to the treatment with the test item: decreased body temperature, decreased hind leg splay, increased/decreased hind limb (grip strength), and increased spontaneous motility

ORGAN WEIGHTS
Treatment and recovery period (recovery restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group):
- 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day: no test item-related influence was noted on the relative or absolute organ weights of the male and female animals at the end of treatment (test day 91) and at the end of the recovery period (test day 119).- statistically significant differences in relative and absolute organ weights compared to the control animals on test day 91 or test day 119 that are not considered to be test item-related are as follows:
Treatment period:
decreased adrenal gland weight (right; absolute)(300 mg/kg bw/day; females; p ≤ 0.05)
increased brain weight (relative)(1000 mg/kg bw/day; males; p ≤ 0.01)
decreased liver weight (absolute)(1000 mg/kg bw/day; males; p ≤ 0.05)
decreased ovary weight (right, relative)(300 mg/kg bw/day; females; p ≤ 0.05)
decreased ovary weight (right, absolute)(300 mg/kg bw/day; females; p ≤ 0.05)

Recovery period:
- 1000 mg/kg bw/day: increased relative weight of prostate and seminal vesicles with coagulating glands (p ≤ 0.05)

GROSS PATHOLOGY
Treatment and recovery period (recovery restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group):
- 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day: no test item-related changes in the organs and tissues of the animals were found after terminal sacrifice at the end of the treatment period (test day 91).No abnormal findings were noted at recovery sacrifice at the end of the 4-week recovery period (test day 119).

- a few minor macroscopic findings were noted which are considered to be not test item-related but to be of spontaneous nature in various organs of individual test item-treated and control animals, which were as follows: 
liver (medial lobe): dark-brown focus or a yellow focus in the 
thymus (left side): dark-red discoloured side
cardiac stomach: haemorrhagic focus
intestines: green-brown content
testes/epididymides: reduced in size and revealed a soft consistency
ovary (right): cystic and enlarged, filled with a dark-red liquid
uterus: dilated, filled with a clear liquid
adrenal gland (right): enlarged 
axilla (left): subcutaneous, solid and red-yellow coloured tissue enlargement 

HISTOPATHOLOGY: NON-NEOPLASTIC
Treatment and recovery period (recovery restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group):
- no treatment-related microscopic changes were noted in the male and female animals of the control group and the 1000 mg/kg bw/day dose group.
- all microscopic changes seen in any organ of any animal are considered to be coincidental, or to be within the normal range of background alterations, which may be seen in untreated rats of this age and strain.- histopathological examination performed on one testicle and one epididymis with special emphasis on the qualitative stages of spermatogenesis (proliferative, meiotic and spermiogenic phases) and histopathology of the interstitial testicular structure, did not reveal any test item-related effects.This high amount strongly suggests a relationship to treatment.BONE MARROW EXAMINATION
Treatment and recovery period (recovery restricted to the control group and 1000 mg/kg bw/day group):
- 1000 mg/kg bw/day: myeloid : erythroid ratio of the male and female animals was not influenced in comparison to the control group at the end of the treatment period and at the end of the recovery period.
see 'Remark'
NOAELUnder the test conditions, the NOAEL was considered to be 500 mg/kg bw/day.The LOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg bw/day for both female and male mice, based on observation of clinical signs in both sexes and decreased bodyweights in males.MORTALITY: 
- 1/10 male and 2/10 females died at 2000 mg/kg bw/day
- 1/10 female died at 500 mg/kg bw/day
- Several animals in other groups died as a result of gavage error.CLINICAL SIGNS: 
- Rough hair coats and decreased activity were observed at 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw/day.HISTOPATHOLOGY
- An alveolar cell adenoma was observed in the lung of 1/10 females that received 2000 mg/kg bw/day.LOAELNOAELUnder the conditons of this subchronic dermal toxicity study in rats, a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 250 mg/kg bw/day was established for linalool based on reduced bw gain at the next higher dose.Based on the criteria outlined in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, linalool does not need to be classified for dermal repeated dose toxicity.CLINICAL SIGNS AND MORTALITY
9 females of the highest dosing group died during the study.Other deaths were not considered treatment related (males: 1 control, 2 high-dose animals / females: 2 low-dose, 1 mid-dose animals)
					
Lethargy was noted in females of the high-dose group during week 3. Rats of the highest dose group had severely depressed motor activity in the evening.This appeared to be an acute effect of the test material, because it was not observed during normal working hours.No tumors were palpated at any time period.								DERMAL IRRITATION
Slight erythema was observed in all linalool treated groups.FOOD CONSUMPTION 
No test substance-related effects.In the low-dose group there was no irritation after week 3.In the mid-dose group there was no irritation after week 6.In the high-dose group slight irritation persisted in most rats until week 13.				
		BODY WEIGHT AND WEIGHT GAIN
Mean body weights in the high-dose group males were lower than control at weeks 2 through 13.Mean body weight in the mid-dose group females were lower than control at week 4 and 8 through 13.Mean body weight in the high-dose group females were less than control at weeks 2&3 but, after some rats died, the remaining rats maintained weights comparable to control.
					FOOD CONSUMPTION
Food consumption was depressed in high-dose males at week 1-3 and 5 and 6.
					ORGAN WEIGHTS
In females, terminal body weight of mid-dose group was decreased and the absolute and relative liver and kidney weights in the high-dose group were increased over control.In males, terminal body weight of high dosed males was reduced.This might be the reason for increased relative organ weights as absolute organ weight were comparable to control.
					HISTOPATHOLOGY: NON-NEOPLASTIC
Animals that died during the experiment were found to have cardiopulmonary disturbances.In more than 50% of control rats, the skin showed a grade 1 epithelial hyperplasia.Squamous epithelial hyperplasia ranged from grade 2 to 3 in all animals of the high-dose group.see 'Remark'
NOAELBased on a temporary reduction in mean body weight gain in males and a first indication of an adverse liver effect at 1000 mg/kg and day.NOAELBased on decreased platelet count and increased diffuse follicular hypertrophy/hyperplasia in thyroid glands of males at 250 mg/kg bw/d and above, the NOAEL was set at 75 mg/kg bw/d.CLINICAL SIGNS AND MORTALITY
One male at 75 mg/kg bw/d was humanely sacrificed on day 86, which was not related to treatment.The animal showed hypothermia, oblique head posture, respiratory sounds and stiff gait.Slight to moderate salivation after treatment for a short period was observed in animals at 250 and 1000 mg/kg bw/d on several days; considered to be related to bad taste of the substance or local affection of the upper digestive tract.BODY WEIGHT AND WEIGHT GAIN
Mean body weight of females at 1000 mg/kg bw/d was signficantly higher on day 28, 42, 56 and 63 and mean body weight changes on day 28, 42 and 63.As body weight/body weight gain was not significantly increased at the end of the administration period, the effects observed is considered to be incidental and not related to treatment.No effects were observed in females at 75 and 250 mg/kg bw/d and males at all dose levels.HAEMATOLOGY
Platelet counts were decreased in males at 250 and 1000 mg/kg bw/d (83 and 85% of control, resp.) and females at 1000 mg/kg bw/d (80% of control).Mean haemoglobin was statistically decreased in males at 1000 mg/kg bw/d (97% of control) and in females at 250 and 1000 mg/kg bw/d (97 and 92% of control, resp.).Only the change at 1000 mg/kg bw/d in females is considered a toxicologically relevant effect as other changes were minimal.Mean red blood cell count was statistically decreased in females at all dose levels (95-93% of control).Bilirubin levels were decreased in all males (82-62% of control) and in females at 250 and 1000 mg/kg bw/d (73-55% of control) in a dose-related manner.Mean haematocrit was decreased in females at 250 and 1000 mg/kg bw/d (97 and 93% of control, resp.).Relative reticulocyte count was increased in males at 1000 mg/kg bw/d (127% of control).Since all means were within historical control range (RBC 7.28-8.25 tera/L), hematocrit 0.378-0.424 L/L, reticulocytes 0.9-2.5%), these effects are not considered treatment-related. CLINICAL CHEMISTRY
In both sexes at 1000 mg/kg bw/d ALT was increased (159% of control for males and 158% for females).Albumin was increased in females at 1000 mg/kg bw/d (109% of control).Total bile acid was slightly decreased in females at 1000 mg/kg bw/d.These bile alterations were regarded as reflecting higher conjugation and excretion rate of bilirubin, but not toxicologically relevant.All other changes were marginal and/or within historical control ranges. URINALYSIS
A higher incidence of phosphate crystals occurred in the urine of both sexes at 1000 mg/kg bw/d.In males at 250 and 1000 mg/kg bw/d specific gravity was increased (dose-related) and, although not significantly, urine volume was lower compared to controls.This is considered to reflect a lower water intake and not toxicologically relevant.NEUROBEHAVIOUR
No treatment-related effects observed during home cage and open field observations.No treatment-related effects observed for sensorimotor tests and reflexes.Motor activity was decreased compared to control in males at 1000 mg/kg bw/d due to decreases at a few single intervals.As no time-related trend was seen, the effect was not considered treatment-related. In females, motor activity was increased compared to control at 1000 mg/kg bw/d overall and at interval 5; also an overall increase was seen at 250 mg/kg bw/d.Since both sexes showed opposite effects, effects showed no time-related trend and these effects were caused by low values for more animals in the control group than in the higher dose animals, the effect was not considered to be treatment-related.All changes were within the historical control range.ORGAN WEIGHTS
The increased liver weights in males (relative: 123% of control) and females (absolute and relative: 132 and 126% of control, resp.) at 1000 mg/kg bw/d as well as the increased absolute and relative weights of thyroid glands (124 and 119% of control, resp.) in females at 1000 mg/kg bw/d were considered treatment-related.The increased relative liver weight in males at 250 mg/kg bw/d was only marginal and had no histopathological correlate; therefore, was not considered treatment-related.The terminal body weight of males at 1000 mg/kg bw/d was decreased (93% of control) resulting in a decrease of the absolute weight of epididymides (94% of control) and increased relative heart and kidney weights (both 113% of control).The increased heart weight (absolute/relative: 111%/107% of control) were not considered to be treatment-related, in the absence of a dose-response relationship and a histopathological correlate.The absolute kidney weight was increased in females at 1000 mg/kg bw/d (109% of control), but not considered treatment-related in absence of a dose-response relationship, no increase in relative kidney weight and histopathological correlate.GROSS PATHOLOGY
Three females at 1000 mg/kg bw/d showed an enlarged liver.HISTOPATHOLOGY: NON-NEOPLASTIC
Fatty change (cytoplasmic vacuolization) of hepatocytes was observed in 3 males and 9 females (2 with enlarged liver) at 1000 mg/kg bw/d.The fatty change was located in the peripheral periportal hepatocytes and characterized by lipid-containing vacuoles.EC 272-723-1 has not been tested for repeat dose toxicity, however experimental data on structurally related substances EC 270-608-0 was available and suitable for read-across.Dilation of lymph vessels mostly in the villi of the cranial part of the jejunum was seen in all treated animals: 0, 2, 8 and 10 males and 0, 4, 8 and 6 females at 0, 75, 250 and 1000 mg/kg bw/d.Lipid-material was shown attached plaque-like to the endothelial wall of some dilated lymph vessels.No signs of inflammation, degenerative changes or effects on lymph nodes was detectable.Therefore, although it might be related to treatment, this was not considered to be toxicologically relevant.The incidence of minimal or slight diffuse follicular hypertrophy/hyperplasia in thyroid glands was increased in males at 250 and 1000 mg/kg bw/d (3 and 6 vs 1 in control) and females at 1000 mg/kg bw/d (4 vs 0 in control).NOELA variable number of eosinophilic droplets was observed in the cytoplasm of proximal tubules in male kidneys without a clear dose-response relationship.This increase was probably due to alpha 2mu-globulin and no tubular injury was noted.Therefore, the increase was not considered adverse.decreased platelet count and increased diffuse follicular hypertrophy/hyperplasia in thyroid glands of males at 250 mg/kg bw/d and above
NOAELThe NOAEL for fertility and development was considered to be 800 mg/kg bw/day.No adverse effects observed
NOAELBased on this study, NOAEL of 160 mg/kg/day for systemic toxicity was proposed for EC 272-723-1.CLINICAL SIGNS AND MORTALITY (PARENTAL ANIMALS)
One male in the 160 mg/kg/day group was euthanized in extremis on study day 17; a gross observation of a thickened stomach was noted at necropsy.Clinical findings noted for this male approximately 1 hour following dose administration on the day of euthanasia consisted of yellow material on various body surfaces, clear material around the mouth, unkempt appearance, decreased defecation, and labored respiration.Microscopically, this male was noted with inflammation, edema, and ulceration in the non-glandular stomach, erosion and inflammation in the trachea, and lymphoid depletion in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (mesenteric, mandibular, and axillary).The lesions in the non glandular stomach were considered test item-related and may have contributed to the moribund state of this male.All other animals in all dosage groups survived to the scheduled necropsies. Test item related clinical findings were noted in the 160 mg/kg/day group males and females and included rales, decreased, shallow, and/or labored respiration and salivation related findings.These findings were noted at the daily examinations, at the time of dosing, and/or approximately 1 hour following dose administration primarily during the treatment period.However, because of their sporadic occurrence, these cardio pulmonary findings were considered to be incidental and secondary to the nature of the test item and the route of administration.BODY WEIGHT AND FOOD CONSUMPTION (PARENTAL ANIMALS)
Mean body weights, body weight changes, and food consumption were unaffected by test item administration in the 10, 40, and 160 mg/kg/day groups throughout the treatment and post-treatment periods.FUNCTIONAL OBSERVATIONAL BATTERY (FOB) AND LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY (PARENTAL ANIMALS)
No test item-related effects were noted during the FOB or locomotor activity evaluations at any dosage level.CLINICAL PATHOLOGY (PARENTAL ANIMALS)
There were no test substance-related effects on serum chemistry, hematology, or coagulation parameters in the 10, 40, and 160 mg/kg/day groups.HAEMATOLOGY
There were no test item-related effects on hematology or coagulation parameters at any dosage level.Significant (p<0.05 or p<0.01) differences were observed when the control and test item-treated groups were compared, and included a higher mean absolute eosinophil count in the 40 mg/kg/day group males at the primary necropsy and a higher mean absolute large unstained cell (LUC) count in the 160 mg/kg/day group females at the recovery (post-treatment) necropsy.These differences were not considered to be test item-related because the values did not show a dose-related response (eosinophils) and were of a magnitude that would be considered to be toxicologically unimportant (LUC).Statistically significant findings that involved percentage reticulocyte or leukocyte differential counts were not itemized above, and were not considered toxicologically important because absolute cell counts are more relevant for interpretative purposes.Mortality
2 male animals of the HD group as well as 4 female animals of the HD group died/were euthanized due to morbidity during the treatment period.ORGAN WEIGHTS (PARENTAL ANIMALS)
There were no test item-related alterations in final body weight or organ weights at any dosage level.Significant (p<0.05) differences were observed when the control and high dose group males were compared at the recovery (post-treatment) necropsy and consisted of lower mean kidney weight relative to body weight, higher mean spleen weight relative to brain weight, higher mean left testis weight relative to brain weight, and higher mean right testis weights (absolute and relative to brain weight).There was no case where all 3 measures (absolute, relative to body weight, and relative to brain weight) were statistically significant.Thus, since the absolute weights and weights relative to body or brain weight were discordant, these organ weight changes were considered to be spurious.GROSS PATHOLOGY (PARENTAL ANIMALS)
One male (no. 61739) in the 160 mg/kg/day group was euthanized in extremis on study day 17.The thickened stomach noted macroscopically for this male was related to test item administration.There were no other test item related internal findings observed for either sex at any dosage level at the scheduled necropsies.Macroscopic findings observed in the test item groups occurred infrequently and/or in a manner that was not dose related.HISTOPATHOLOGY (PARENTAL ANIMALS)
Test item-related histologic observations of epithelial hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and inflammation of the non-glandular stomach, typically at the limiting ridge, but sometimes more widespread, were noted in the 160 mg/kg/day group males and females.Localized injury to the nonglandular portion of the stomach.A combined oral repeated dose study with screening for reproductive and/ or developmental effects was performed according to OECD/EC guidelines and GLP principles.C12-14 Alkyl ethoxylated glycidylether was administered by daily oral gavage to male and female rats at dose levels of 83, 250 and 750 mg/kg bw/day.Based on the results of this study, the parental NOEL was concluded 250 mg/kg/day (based on lower body weight gain and food consumption, increased liver weights in males, a thickened forestomach in males and hyperplasia in the forestomach in males and females at 750 mg/kg/day).As these fefects were considered to be non-adverse, the NOAEL was found to be 750 mg/kg bw/day.No adverse effects observed up to and including highest dose tested (750 mg/kg bw/day)
NOAELIn a reliable study, conducted using a protocol similar to OECD guideline 408, male and female rats were fed diets containing 0, 0.2%, 1% or 5% Dobanol-45 (providing average intakes of 169, 747 or 3548 mg/kg bw/day, respectively) for 90 days.Effects seen at doses higher than 0.2% included increased liver enzyme activity (alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase) and increased relative weights of a number of organs, which is attributable to the reduced body weight due to lower food consumption as a result of lack of palatability.It is considered that the increases in hepatic enzymes are not adverse as there was no associated pathology.It is therefore concluded that the NOAEL is 3548 mg/kg bw/day, the highest dose tested.CLINICAL SIGNS AND MORTALITY
No animals died during the study and clinical signs were unremarkable.BODY WEIGHT AND WEIGHT GAIN
Reduced at 1% and 5%

FOOD CONSUMPTION AND COMPOUND INTAKE (if feeding study)
Reduced at 1% and 5% (water consumption was also reduced at these dietary levels).Food loss due to spillage was frequently reported in these groups.White blood cell count was significantly increased in high-dose females (100/mm3: control 47 (SD +- 12.2); top dose 73.2 (SD +-16.2)). CLINICAL CHEMISTRY
See Table 1, below.Alkaline phosophatase (AP) activity increased from 1%; Total protein increased at 1% and 5% in males and at 5% in females.At 5%, alanine aminotransferase activity increased (ALAT), albumin/globulin ratio (AG) increased, (in females) total cholesterol reduced and (in males) potassium increased.URINALYSIS
No treatment-related changes

ORGAN WEIGHTS
See Table 2, below.The most significant effects on organ weights were:
Increased relative weight of thyroid, liver and kidney in males and females at 5%.HISTOPATHOLOGY: NON-NEOPLASTIC
No significant treatment-related effects.  Decreased absolute weight of brain in males and females at 5%.Relative liver, kidney, adrenal, thyroid and hypophysis weights increased in males (adrenal and thyroid effect also seen in mid-dose males).Relative thyroid, kidney and liver weights increased in high-dose females (the liver and kidney were also significantly affected in mid-dose females). No biologically signficant changes in either absolute or relative organ weights were observed at the low-dose level (0.2%).GROSS PATHOLOGY
No treatment-related effects.There were no other remarkable changes.No  abnormalites were observed in any other organs including the gonads.Average dose.Effects observed on body weight, food consumption and food efficiency were considered to be attributable to lower food consumption as a result of lack of palatability.Effects noted on clinical chemistry were not considered adverse.NOEL = highest dose tested
NOELNo adverse effects on reproduction or development were noted.This study is a valid investigation of the toxicological effects resulting from repeated oral-gavage administration of the test item Sodium Sulphate to rats.Sodium Sulphate was administered in highly purified water as vehicle at dosages of 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg body weight/day, and controls received the vehicle only.Sodium Sulphate was administered to male rats for at least 28 days and to female rats for 14 days prior to pairing, through the pairing and gestation periods until the F1 generation reached day 4 post partum. In absence of any effect the general NOEL (No Observed Effect Level) was established at 1000 mg/kg/day.As no effects were observed, the NOEL (No Observed Effect Level) for reproduction/ developmental toxicity was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day.Based on the results of the study and since the induced hyaline droplet nephropathy in male rats is known to be a rat-specific lesion and not relevant for human, the general NOAEL was considered to be 800 mg/kg bw/day.The induced hyaline droplet nephropathy in male rats is known to be a rat-specific lesion and is not relevant for human
NOAELThe NOAEL for reproductive toxicity was ≤ 0.10% (126 mg/kg bw) and the NOAEL general toxicity was <0.5% (630 mg/kg bw).inflammatory changes in stomachs (it was not possible to conclude they were directly related to maleic anhydride)
LOELwith methyloxirane by gavage to male and female
Wistar rats for 3 months caused signs of systemic toxicity at the highest dose level tested
(150 mg/kg bw/d).The target organs were liver and kidney for both genders.Therefore, under the conditions of the present study the no observed adverse effect level
(NOAEL) was 30 mg/kg bw/d for male and female Wistar rats.No adverse effects observed at this dose level.Effects of the test substance for all males and females were not observed in less than 250 mg/kg in the toxicological change.However, two dead females in the 500 mg/kg treatment group had occurred, and findings of gaseous distension of gastrointestinal tract were observed.Also, transient salivations were observed in all males of the 500 mg/kg treatment group from Day 20 of administration to completion of administration and in four females of the 500 mg/kg treatment group from Day 2 of gestation to completion of administration, sporadically or persistently.Mucous stool, soft stool, and dirty nose were observed in one male of the 500 mg/kg treatment group.Therefore, a NOAEL for repeated dose toxicity was determined at 250 mg/kg in all males and females.CLINICAL SIGNS AND MORTALITY: In the main group, death was observed in one female (2403) of the 500 mg/kg treatment group on Day 16 of administration. And In the recovery group, death was observed in one female (2416) of the 500 mg/kg treatment group on Day 52 of administration.In the main group, no clinical signs were observed in males and females of 125 mg/kg treatment group and in females of the 250 mg/kg treatment group.But, transient salivations which appeared immediately after administrations were sporadically observed in four males of the 250 mg/kg treatment group from Day 22 of administration to completion of administration.In addition, mucous stool, soft stool, and dirty nose were observed in one male (1407) of the 500 mg/kg treatment group on Day 22 and 23.In the recovery group, transient salivations were observed in almost all males of the 500 mg/kg treatment group from Day 16 of administration to completion of administration and in almost all females of the 500 mg/kg treatment group from Day 20 of administration to completion of administration, sporadically or persistently.DETAILED CLINICAL SIGNS: No detailed clinical signs were observed in all animals of the control and treatment groups.BODY WEIGHT AND WEIGHT GAIN
In the main group, no treatment-related abnormalities in body weight gain were noted in all animals of the control and treatment groups.In females of the recovery group, body weights on Day 55 of administration were significantly decreased (p<0.05) compared with the control group in the 500 mg/kg treatment group.CLINICAL CHEMISTRY
In the main group, phosphorus (P) was significantly decreased (p< 0.05) compared with the control group in females of the 125 mg/kg treatment group.Besides, no treatment-related abnormalities in body weight gain were noted in all males.FOOD CONSUMPTION AND COMPOUND INTAKE
In the main group, no treatment-related abnormalities in food consumption were noted in all animals of the control and treatment groups.In feamles of the recovery group, food consumtpion was significantly decreased (p<0.05) compared to with the control group on Day 13 and 34 of administration in the 500 mg/kg treatment group.Besides, no treatment-related abnormalities in food consumption were noted in all males.FOOD EFFICIENCY

HAEMATOLOGY
In the main group, no treatment-related abnormalities in hematology were noted in all animals of the control and treated groups.In the recovery group, eosinophils (EOS) of males and phrotrombin time (PT) of females were significantly increased (p<0.05) compared with the control group in the 500 mg/kg treatment group.In females of the recovery group, triglycerides (TG, p<0.05), total proteins (TP, p<0.05), and albumin (Alb, p<0.01) were significantly decreased compared with the control group in the 500 mg/kg treatment group.URINALYSIS
In the main and recovery groups, no treatment-related abnormalities were noted in the urinalysis parameters

NEUROBEHAVIOUR
Sensory reflex and motor function test: No treatment-related abnormalities in the pinna reflex, auditory reflex, corneal reflex, papillary reflex, traction, rota rod, and open field test were observed in all animals of the control and treatment groups

ORGAN WEIGHTS
In the main group, no treatment-related abnormalities in absolute and relative organ weights of the males were noted compared with the control group.However, in females, absolute organ weights of kidney were significantly decreated (p<0.05, p<0.01) compared with the control group in all treatment groups, and relative organ weights of uterus were significantly decreased (p<0.05) compared with the control group in the 500 mg/kg treatment group.In the recovery group, no treatment-related abnormalities in absolute and relative organ weights of the males were noted.However, in females, fasted body weights (p<0.01) and absolute organ weights (p<0.05) were significantly decreased compared with the control group in all treatment groups.GROSS PATHOLOGY
In the necropsy findings of the main group agenesis of spleen was observed in one male (1302) of the 250 mg/kg treatment group, and yellow spot of epididymis was observed in one male (1408) of the 500 mg/kg treatment group.The other abdominal signs were not observed, and the necropsy finding of the recovery group was not noted.In the necropsy findings for dead animals, gaseous distension was observed in one female (2403) of the 500 mg/kg treatment group in the main group on Day 16 of administration.In the recovery group, gaseous distension, severe hydronephrosis of left kidney and dilation of left uterine horn were observed in one female (2416) of the 500 mg/kg treatment group on Day 52 of administration.HISTOPATHOLOGY: NON-NEOPLASTIC
In the main group, cast of kidney was observed in one male (1104) of the control group, and sper granuloma of epididymis was observed in one male (1408) of the 500 mg/kg treatment group.The other abnormal findings were not observed.The high levels of fed betaine in the current studyhave probably resulted in a physiological imbalance or disturbance, which is unlikely to be relevant to normal human intake.In the recovery group, basophilic tubules of kidney was observed in one female (2119) of the control group.In the 500 mg/kg treatment group of the main group female, no histopathological change in one dead animal (2403) was observed.In the 500 mg/kg treatment group of the recovery female, renal tissue in one dead animal (2416) was not observed by severe hydronephrosis of gross findings, and left uterine horn was dilated; however, no histopathological change was observed.HISTOPATHOLOGY: NEOPLASTIC (if applicable)

NOAELBased on the above findings it can be concluded that the dose 2000 mg/kg b.w.All other histopathological changes observed were fairly equally distributed among the control and test animals or occurred in one or a few rats only.of Sodium Vinyl Sulphonate Solution (Provichem 2202) is non-toxic to Wistar rats in respect to combined repeated dose and Reproduction/Developmental toxicity, therefore the NOAEL of the test substance is regarded as >=2000 mg/kg body weight.No effects observed in any of the examined parameters.For all observations made.During the treatment period, no significant signs of systemic toxicity were seen in any of the treatment groups.Due to hight tolerance of betaine No Adverse Effect Level could not be determined, the highest (5% feed) being estimated 500 times the exposure estimate for human being.The hepatic effects did not indicate chronic toxicity - no signs of hepatic necrosis or bile duct hyperplasia were seen, but may be due to an effect on intermediary metabolism.Moreover, they are common findings in the Sprague-Dawley strain of rats used in this study.There was no indication that the type, incidence or severity of the lesions were influenced by the feeding of betaine.No effect level could not be determined, betaine is well tolerated.At the highest dose 5% (approx.500X expected human intake) no adverse effects were seen.Slight effect: some hepatic and haematological changes.The NOAEL for this 13 week dietary feeding study in rats is ca 750 mg/kg/day (males 723, females 875) based on reduced weight gain and food consumption.The toxicological significance of observed changes in organ weights, all in the absence of histopathological change, is questionable.Increased liver weights at higher dose levels may be indicative of a mild adaptive effect on the liver.In a reliable study conducted according to draft OECD guideline 422, parental NOAEL was 2000 mg/kg bw/day and the NOAEL for reproductive and developmental effects can be considered as 2000 mg/kg bw/day (highest dose level).mortality; body weight; food consumption and compound intake; gross pathology; organ weights; histopathology; number of implantation sites; duration of pregnancy; pregnancy index
NOAELno adverse effects noted up to and including 100 000 ppm
NOAELUnder the present test conditions the following findings were made:
Effects on the parental generation:
None of the parental animals died prematurely.The only treatment-related finding, not regarded as adverse, was piloerection noted in few male or female rats from a dose level of 100 mg cobalt sulphide/kg bw/day onwards.Macroscopic inspection did not reveal any test item-related changes at necropsy.Histopathological inspection did not reveal any pathological changes.No test item-related influence was noted on the sperm staging or interstitial cell structure (qualitative examination).The NO(A)EL were determined to be 1000 mg/kg bw/day.Effects on the reproduction: no test item-related influence was noted on mating behaviour, fertility, implantation, the gestation length or the birth index.Effects on the development of the conceptus and the F1 offspring (pups):
No test item-related influence was noted at 100, 300 or 1000 mg cobalt sulphide/kg bw/day on the growth and development of the offspring from conception until sacrifice on day 4 post-partum or shortly thereafter.
The NO(A)EL were determined to be 1000 mg/kg bw/day.The only treatment-related finding, not regarded as adverse, was piloerection noted in few male or female rats from a dose level of 100 mg cobalt sulphide/kg bw/day onwards.Classified as: Not classified.original NCD unit is mg/kg/day
NOAELUnder the present test conditions the following findings were made:

Effects on the parental generation:
Piloerection, reduced motility, soft faeces/diarrhoea and reduced food consumption were noted - in relation to the dose - from a dose level of 100 mg cobalt
powder/kg bw/day onwards.In addition, reductions of body weight were noted from 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day onwards. Premature deaths occurred in five female rats at 100 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day and eight female rats at 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day.Treatment with 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day caused the premature death of nine of ten males and all ten females.Macroscopic inspection revealed changes of the gastro-intestinal tract - mainly in the prematurely deceased animals - from a dose level of 100 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day onwards and adrenal changes and pulmonal lesions at 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day.For the macroscopical lesions noted at necropsy no histopathological correlate could be found.The NO(A)EL were determined to be 30 mg/kg bw/day.Effects on the reproduction / Effects on the development of the conceptus and the F1-offspring (pups):
Treatment with 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day resulted in an increase of the post-implantation loss and a decrease in the live birth index.No test item-related influence was noted on mating behaviour, fertility and the gestation length.From 30 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day onwards, the mean litter weight of pups was slightly reduced in a dose-related way (not significant at p ≤ 0.01), significant only at 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day.An increased F1-offspring mortality rate and a slightly decreased viability index were noted from 100 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day onwards.Based on mortality, clinical signs of toxicity, effects on food consumption and macroscopic pathological changes observed at and above 100 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day and reduced body weight at and above 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day.Under the present test conditions the following findings were made:

Effects on the parental generation:
Pilo-erection, reduced motility, soft faeces/diarrhoea and reduced food consumption were noted - in relation to the dose - from a dose level of 100 mg cobalt
powder/kg bw/day onwards.The NO(A)EL were determined to be 30 mg/kg bw/day.CLINICAL SIGNS AND MORTALITY
Mortality:
- 30 mg/kg bw/day: no deaths
- 100 mg/kg bw/day: 5/10 females died (one female died prematurely on gestation day 21 and four females died between lactation days 2 to 4)
- 300 mg/kg bw/day: 8/10 females died (two female rats died during the mating period on test days 15 or 27, two further females died on gestation day 20 or 21 and four females died on the first lactation day)
- 1000 mg/kg bw/day: 9/10 males died (death on test day 12 to 24); 10/10 females died (four of them during the mating period, one during littering and five of them during the gestation period)

Clinical signs:
- males (pre-mating, mating and post-mating period): none of the male animals treated with 30 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day revealed any test item-related signs of systemic toxicity.Pilo-erection was noted in two of ten male rats treated with 100 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day and in three male rats of ten treated with 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day for one to three test days.Laboured breathing was noted in one further male treated with 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day on one test day.Pilo-erection, reduced motility and soft faeces were noted in the only surviving high dose male rat treated with 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day on one or two test days before sacrifice on test day 39.The nine prematurely deceased male rats revealed the following symptoms on one or a few days before death: pilo-erection, reduced motility, a haemorrhagic nose and/or soft faeces (soiled anus) were noted in all or several deceased males.In addition, hunched posture or abdominal position, slightly decreased respiratory rate, reduced body temperature (animal cold at touch), laboured breathing, ptosis and/or a pale skin (ears or whole body) were observed in one or a few males.- females (pre-mating and mating period): no test item-related signs of systemic toxicity were noted in the female animals treated with 30 or 100 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day.Soft faeces were noted in one low dose dam (treated with 30 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day) on test day 17, this incidence is considered to be still within the spontaneous range as no corresponding findings were observed at 100 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day.From 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day onwards, pilo-erection and soft faeces were noted in a few to several females on a few test days.- females (gestation period): none of the females treated with 30 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day revealed any test item-related signs of systemic toxicity during the gestation period.Pilo-erection was noted from 100 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day onwards and reduced motility and soft faeces or diarrhoea were noted from 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day onwards in individual to nearly all females in relation to the dose.- females (lactation period): none of the females treated with 30 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day revealed any test item-related signs of systemic toxicity during the lactation period.From 100 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day onwards, pilo-erection, reduced motility, soft faeces or diarrhoea were noted in nearly all females during the lactation period.In addition, hunched posture, decreased respiratory rate, reduced body temperature (animal cold at touch), dyspnoea, tremor, miosis, ptosis, a haemorrhagic nose,
haemorrhagic urine, soft faeces or diarrhoea were observed.In addition, a pale skin was observed in some animals.Detailed clinical observations: 
- males: no further changes in the male rats as already stated above.- females: findings stated above were confirmed.Thin hair was observed for one low dose female from test week 5 onwards.For male HD animals, an attenuated body weight gain was observed during the pre-mating period but not during the mating and post-mating period.BODY WEIGHT AND WEIGHT GAIN (1000 mg/kg bw/day group was excluded from statistical comparison due to a high mortality rate)
- males: the body weight in 300 and 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day groups was reduced from test week 2 onwards, being 13% (statistically significant at p ≤ 0.01) or 16% below the control value in test week 3 (mating period).The body weight at autopsy was reduced as well (12% below the control value) in the 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day group.The body weight of the only surviving high dose male rat (1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day) was slightly below the mean control value.- females: the body weight of the female rats in the 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day group was below the control on gestation day 20 (by 11%) and on lactation day 1 (by 21%, statistically significant at p ≤ 0.01).The body weight of the two surviving females was still reduced on lactation day 4 and at autopsy (20% or 19% below the control value).The body weight of the female rats in the 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day group was distinctly below the control (by 17%, no statistical comparison) on gestation day 14.FOOD CONSUMPTION (1000 mg/kg bw/day group was excluded from statistical comparison due to a high mortality rate)
- males: no test item-related influence was noted during the premating period at any tested dose level.- females: the relative food intake of the animals treated with 100 or 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day was distinctly or severely below that of the control group by minus 37% or minus 68% on lactation day 1, being statistically significant at p ≤ 0.01 at 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day on lactation day 1.On lactation day 4 the food intake of the five surviving females of the 100 mg/kg bw/day group or the two surviving females of the 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day was still reduced by minus 40% or minus 65% compared to the corresponding food consumption of the control animals.A slight reduction of food intake (19% below the control value) was noted for the two high dose rats (1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day) which were still alive on gestation day 14.No further data on food intake was available as both dams died shortly thereafter.WATER CONSUMPTION
- males: reduced intake of drinking water was noted in deceased rats treated with 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day on one to a few test days before premature death.- females: reduced intake of drinking water was noted in several deceased females treated with 100, 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day and in deceased rats treated with 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day on one to a few test days before premature death.HAEMATOLOGY (1000 mg/kg bw/day group was excluded from statistical comparison due to a high mortality rate)
- males and females: no test item-related changes in haematological parameters were noted at the end of the premating period (test day 15) of male and female rats treated with 30, 100, 300 or 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg b.w./day compared to the control.CLINICAL CHEMISTRY (1000 mg/kg bw/day group was excluded from statistical comparison due to a high mortality rate)
- males and females: no test item-related changes were noted on biochemical parameters on test day 15 of male and female rats treated with 30, 100, 300 or 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day compared to the control.NEUROBEHAVIOUR (1000 mg/kg bw/day group was excluded due to a high mortality rate)
1) Observational screening: 
- males: no test item-related influence was noted.- females: at 30 mg/kg bw/day no test item-related influence was noted.Females treated with 100 and 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day revealed pilo-erection and diarrhoea.The following changes were noted for the females treated with 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day: no response to the toe and tail pinch, a reduced hind leg splay (significant at p ≤ 0.01), no resistance to limb rotation, impairment of wire manoeuvre, a reduced or increased respiration, no positive geotropism or a distinctly reduced body temperature.These findings have to be seen in connection with the moribund condition of two of four female animals.All lesions are regarded to be test item-related.2) Functional observations: 
- males and females: at 100 and 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day revealed reductions for the forelimb grip strength in both sexes (statistically significant at p ≤ 0.01 in the males) and for the hind limb grip strength in the females (statistically significant at p ≤ 0.01 at 300 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day).Spontaneous motility was not influenced by the test item at any tested dose level.ORGAN WEIGHTS (300 and 1000 mg/kg bw/day groups were excluded from statistical comparison)
- males and females: no test item-related findings were noted.GROSS PATHOLOGY
- males: at 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day, a reddened stomach was noted in the only survivor of ten males of the high dose level. Macroscopic inspection of the prematurely deceased nine males revealed pathological changes of the adrenals (enlarged and / or reddened) and the gastro-intestinal region (reddened intestines, caecum or stomach) in nearly all animals.In addition, lesions of the lungs (oedematous) were noted in some animals, changes of thymus (reddened) were seen in two of nine animals.- females: from a dose level of 100 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day onwards, changes of the gastrointestinal tract (reddened, haemorrhagic foci, filled with fluid) were noted - in relation to the dose - in a few to several animals.In addition, a reddened thymus was noted in a few females treated with 100 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day.These lesions are regarded to be test item-related.Further changes were noted at 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day in the form of enlarged and / or reddened adrenals in nearly all animals and oedematous lungs in some animals.These lesions are regarded to be test item-related.Frequent macroscopic observations of abnormal colour (blue or dark) and/or abnormal content (blue or dark) in several tissues were not correlated histopathologically.HISTOPATHOLOGY: NON-NEOPLASTIC
- males and females: histomorphological examination of rat organs after treatment with either 30, 100, 300 or 1000 mg cobalt powder/kg bw/day did not reveal any morphological lesions which are considered to be related to the test item.For the macroscopical lesions noted at necropsy no histological correlate could be found.Oral administration of the substance was well tolerated in the adult animals but was associated with changes in the kidneys of females treated at 1000 mg/kg/day. An increased presence of brownish pigment in the cortical tubules of 6/10 animals, identified as lipofuscin and considered to be accompanied by test item material, was identified. This finding was considered non-adverse.In the context of this study, the substance showed no evidence of being an endocrine disruptor.The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for systemic toxicity was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day.No adverse effects were seen on body weight or food consumption.The behavior of the animals in the arena was not affected by treatment.Sensory reactivity and grip strength were also unaffected by treatment but females receiving 1000 mg/kg/day were less active than the controls. The haematological investigation revealed slightly low haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration in males receiving 1000 mg/kg/day and high neutrophil and low lymphocytes counts in females receiving 1000 mg/kg/day.These effects were considered not related to treatment.Clinical biochemistry showed decrease in alanine amino-transferase activity and increase in triglyceride concentrations in males at 1000 mg/kg/day.Aspartate amino-transferase activity was high for females receiving 1000 mg/kg/day.A/G ratios were low in all female groups and in the high dose females this associated with a reduction in plasma albumin concentration.In the absence of any effects seen on liver weights and no remarkable histopathological findings reported in the liver the small variations in the hepatic enzymes and triglyceride concentrations were considered non-adverse.The profile of proteins in the plasma may also be influenced by changes in hepatic metabolism (influencing the production) but also by kidney function (controlling the excretion).The mineralization seen in the kidneys, which was considered incidental, may however have contributed to a disturbance in renal metabolism and therefore, the variations in the plasma proteins may also be incidental and not directly related to treatment. The microscopic evaluation of the tissues revealed an increased presence of brownish pigment in the cortical tubules of the kidneys of 6/10 females treated at 1000 mg/kg/day, identified by special staining as lipofuscin (considered of limited or no functional significance, (Frazier et al, 2012)), but it was considered that test item material was also present.Due to the minimal severity and the lack of associated kidney pathology, the presence of lipofuscin and test item material in the cortical tubules was considered non-adverse.Incidences and severities of mineralization observed in kidney, stomach and heart are considered incidental and unrelated to treatment.The increased pigment presence was not related to mineralisation and was an integral effect of treatment, but as stated above considered non-adverse.Kidney weights were increased in males and females treated at 1000 mg/kg/day.There was no clear histopathological correlate for this.These changes are considered to represent the colour of the test item, which was likely removed during fixation or processing.no adverse effects observed
NOAELAt a dose level of 500 mg/kg body weight mortalities occurred in male and female animals.Furthermore, clinical symptoms were recognized in HD group, which are clearly considered to be adverse.Thus, the NOAEL for male and female animals in this study is considered to be 200 mg/kg body weight.The male animals were found dead/euthanized on mating and post-mating days 8 and 15.The female animals were found dead/euthanized on Premating Days 13 (twice) as well as gestation days 17 and 19. 
No mortality occurred in the other treatment or control groups. Clinical Observations
For a detailed description of the findings see Table 9, Table 10, Table 40 and Table 41.Several clinical symptoms were found which could be clearly attributed to the test item.In male treatment animals e.g. vocalization (4/10 HD animals), moving the bedding (3/10 HD animals; 1/10 MD animal), abnormal breathing (9/10 HD animals, 1/10 MD animal), slight piloerection (10/10 HD animals, 7/10 MD animals, 1/10 LD animals), moderate piloerection (8/10 HD animals, 4/10 MD animals, 1/10 LD animals) were found increased when compared with C group. In female treatment animals e.g. vocalization (5/10 HD animals), half eyelid closure (2/10 HD animals), moving the bedding (8/10 HD animals), abnormal breathing (10/10 HD animals), moderate salivation (3/10 HD animals, 1/10 MD animals), slight salivation (4/10 HD animals, 1/10 MD animals, 1/10 LD animals), slight piloerection (10/10 HD animals, 9/10 MD animals, 2/10 LD animals), moderate piloerection (10/10 HD animals, 1/10 MD animals, 1/10 LD animals), severe piloerection (4/10 HD animals) were observed.One female animal of the LD group bite the cannula off and swallowed it.This animal was observed with a high frequency in order to detect abnormalities due to the swallowed cannula. Functional Observations
No relevant effects were observed in any of the parameters of the functional observation battery before and at the end of the treatment period.Body temperature of female HD animals was slightly increased at the end of the treatment.This could be treatment related and of toxicological relevance. Body Weight Development
In male animals body weight increase was comparable for C, LD, and MD animals during the treatment period.This attenuated body weight gain can be attributed to the test item and is assumed to be of toxicological relevance. In female animals body weight was significantly lower in HD group when compared to C group (p<0.01).Furthermore, body weight gain was significantly attenuated in HD group between GD0 and GD7 (p<0.05).Furthermore, body weight gain was attenuated during the whole pre-mating and gestation period in HD animals.Since this data is still in the range of our historical C data and since not dose dependency could be found it is not assumed to be test item related. A tendency to attenuation could be also mentioned for LD and MD groups during the gestation period.However, for LD and MD groups a test item relation cannot be clearly considered.For HD group a test item relation can be mentioned which is assumed to be toxicological relevant. Food Consumption
In correlation to the body weight and body weight change, the food consumption in both males and females showed some differences in treatment groups when compared with C group.In males statistical significant decreased food consumption was found during pre-mating days 7-14 which was also found as a tendency during pre-mating days 1-7.These slight decreases were not statistically significant and not dose dependent.In females statistical significant decreased food consumption was evaluated in HD group during GD 7-14.Again, this was found as a tendency during the whole gestation period.For MD animals a tendency to decreased food consumption was also found during the gestation period. Since the decreased food consumption of the HD animals correlates with an attenuated body weight gain this is considered to be test item related and of toxicological relevance.A test item relation can be also mentioned for MD animals which cannot be clearly stated to be toxicological relevant. Haematology and Coagulation
At the end of the treatment period a slight tendency towards an increased amount of white blood cells could be observed in male HD animals (6.04 x 103/µl) when compared to C animals (4.68 x 103/µl).No statistical significance as well as no dose dependency could be detected.Hence, this increase is not assumed to be test item related. In female animals, an increased percentage of monocytes could be observed.This increase was dose dependent but not statistical significant.All other values of haematology and of coagulation are not changed when comparing treatment groups and C group. 1.88 % (C ), 2.48 % (LD), 5.78 (MD), and 12.98 % (HD) were measured.The HD value is above to what could be expected when comparing with our historical C data.This increased amount of monocytes could be test item related as well as toxicological relevant in the HD group.Percentage of eosinophils of female animals was significantly increased in MD animals (0.83 %) when compared to C animals (0.24 %).Furthermore, percentage of eosinophils in HD group was slightly but not significantly increased with 0.65 %).Clinical Biochemistry
For a detailed description see Table 29, Table 30, Table 62 and Table 63.At the end of the treatment period levels of Cholesterol were significantly increased in male LD group (1.17; p<0.05) and HD group (1.18; p<0.05) when compared with C group (0.86).Animals of MD group exhibited a Chol value of 0.98.Values of LD and HD group were above to what could be expected regarding our historical C data.Although no clear dose dependency was detected, these increased values could be test item related and may indicate liver or kidneys as target organ.However, due to the absence of clear other findings (e.g. histopathology) and due to the mild characteristics of the increase a toxicological relevance is not assumed.This decrease was not statistical significant.Levels of TBA were significantly increased (p<0.05) in male LD group when compared with C group.20.26 as well as 9.3 could be measured, respectively.Since no increase was found for MD and HD group, this is assumed to be not test item related. In female animals, values of SGOT (ASAT) were slightly (p>0.05) decreased in treatment groups.47.0 (C ), 38.7 (LD), 39.1 (MD), as well as 35.2 (HD) were measured.A test item relation cannot be excluded but seems unlikely.Changes in serum levels of ASAT may indicate a liver, heart, or muscle disturbance.However, this is related to increased but not decreased values.Furthermore, since no other parameter indicates a disturbance of these organs/tissues a toxicological relevance is not assumed. Values of Phosphate are slightly decreased in HD group (1.74) when compared to C group (3.21).Several reasons exist for slightly low phosphate levels and the irritant effects of the test item could be e.g. responsible for a decreased absorption of phosphate from the food.However, since no other clear indications for the reason of the decreased phosphate levels are detected and since the decrease is not statistical significant it is assumed that this decrease may be test item related but is without toxicological relevance within this study. Urinalysis
The urinalysis performed in male animals revealed no test- item related effect in any of the treatment groups compared to the control group.The urine analysis in female animals revealed increased blood content in HD animals as well as an increased protein content in treatment groups.Taken both things together, this may indicate the kidneys as a target organ.However, since no systematic finding was detected during histopathology and clinical biochemistry and since no organ weight changes were measured the test item relation and toxicological relevance seems unlikely.Especially in case of the blood content, contaminations during the necropsy could be responsible for this. Evaluation of Sperm Count and Sperm Motility
At the end of the treatment period, no influence of the test item could be found on sperm motility or sperm head counts.The treatment groups were comparable to the C group and showed values which could be expected for healthy animals of this age. Pathology
Few specific gross pathological changes were recorded for the male and female animals of the HD group which were assumed to be test item related and of toxicological relevance.E.g. a gased gastro-intestinal tract could be mentioned in 4/10 female HD animals as well as 2/10 male HD animals.A small sized spleen or thymus was found in 2/10 female HD animals. Organ Weight
In male animals absolute weight of spleens was slightly increased in MD groups and was significantly increased (p<0.05) in HD group.The weights were 0.614 g (C), 0.722 g (MD) and 0.809 g (HD).This could be partly confirmed by weights in relation to body weight where 0.173 % (C ), 0.197 %(MD), and 0.228 % (HD) were mentioned.In female animals, absolute weights of spleens of HD group were slightly increased when compared to C group.This could be confirmed by relative weights (to body weight) and 0.63 g (C ) as well as 0.54 g (HD) could be measured.In particular, 0.732 g as well as 0.647 g could be measured, respectively.This could be confirmed by relative spleen weights of female animals, Respective 0.307 % (HD) as well as 0.269 % (C ) were found.Increased spleen weights could be an indicator of an immune stimulation.However, no clear pattern could be found during the histopathological analysis.Since histopathology is kown to be a more sensitive parameter than simple weight measurements and since spleen weights are known for a relatively high interanimal variability a toxicological relevance seems unlikely but however cannot be excluded for the male HD group. Absolute prostate weights (plus seminal vesicles and coagulating glands) was decreased in male HD group (1.89 g) when compared to C group (2.2 g).Due to the high variability as well as the absent histopathological findings a test item relation is not assumed. In male animals, absolute weights of thymus were slightly increased in HD group (0.43 g) when compared to C group (0.39 g).Relative organ weights of male animals showed no alteration.In female animals, absolute weights of thymus were slightly decreased.When compared with C group (0.272 g), a decrease towards 0.227 g(LD), 0.255 g (MD), and 0.203 g (HD) were evaluated.This could be confirmed by relative thymus weights (to body weight).0.113 % (C ); 0.096 % (LD), 0.103 % (MD), 0.085 % (HD) were calculated.Due to the mile characteristics of the increase (female) and decease (male) a test item relation cannot be clearly stated.A toxicological relevance within this study cannot be considered. In female animals, weights of uteri (with cervix) showed a slight tendency to a dose dependent decrease.Two males and four females treated at 500 mg/kg/day died or were sacrificed moribund during the treatment period, all of which showed gaseous distension of the gastrointestinal tract.As absolute weights 0.686 g (C ), 0.654 g (LD), 0.604 (MD), and 0.598 (HD) were measured.This could not be confirmed by relative weights (to body weight).Since no statistical significance could be calculated, since the relative uterus weights did not confirm the absolute weights and since no clear histopathological findings could be detected, a test item relation couldnot be clearly mentioned.Hence, a toxicological relevance within this study cannot be assumed. Histopathology
For a detailed description of the individual findings see Appendix 3.Among these, male No. 40, found dead, had prominent findings in the respiratory system, indicative of gavaging error or regurgitation/aspiration of test item formulation into the airways.The other five decedents showed combinations of histological lesions in the gastrointestinal and/or respiratory tract which were indicative of a local irritant effect of the test item formulation.Degenerative/atrophic changes of the lymphoid organs and hypocellularity of the bone marrow in all of these animals were considered to be secondary to bad general condition and/or agonal stress.There was no clear indication of a direct toxic effect of the test item on any of the organs evaluated in these animals, including the reproductive organs.There was no indication of test item-related histopathological findings in reproductive organs of the surviving male or female rats of this study.The reproductive organs of the females found non-gravid at terminal sacrifice showed normal reproductive sexual cycle.No directly test item-related histopathological findings were noted in the other organs evaluated in this study.Minimal tracheal changes in two surviving animals treated at 500 mg/kg/day were considered to be most probably related to a local irritant effect of the test item formulation.Based on the lack of treatment-related effects, the subchronic toxicity NOAEL was determined to be 1000 mg/kg bw/day.- No toxic/clinical signs were observed at any of the tested doses either during treatment or recovery periods.- No pre-terminal deaths were observed at any of the tested doses in both sexes.
- No treatment related changes in weekly mean body weights and cumulative net body weight gains in either sex during treatment and recovery periods.- Food intake showed no inter group difference in either sex during treatment and recovery periods.- No treatment-related changes in haematological parameters were observed at any of the tested doses in both sexes.
- No treatment-related changes in biochemical parameters were observed at any of the tested doses in both sexes.
- There were no treatment related changes in the terminal fasting body weights, organ weights and organ weight ratios.
- There were no treatment related gross and microscopic findings.No treatment related adverse effects were observed.Based on the data that was reported the No-Observed-Effect-Level (NOEL) following dermal administration of fatty alcohol blend for a minimum of 90 days was stated to be less than 100 mg/kg/day.This is based primarily on the local irritation (and related) effects.Excessive struggling was also reported during exposure on single occasions for one male in the low dose group and two female in the high dose group.The local irritation effects are considered adverse and therefore the local, dermal Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (LOAEL) is 100 mg/kg/day (2.8 mg/cm3 based on test substance applied to 2% body surface area at this dose).It should be noted that the test substance was repeatedly applied to already damaged skin, which may have exacerbated the effects noted.Furthermore the dermal effects noted were variable in terms of the relationship of severity with duration of administration.The clinical signs and effects on body weight and food consumption are considered to be a consequence of the local irritant effect and the effects on white blood cell counts and albumin and globulin levels attributable to the acute dermal inflammatory response.The increased adrenal weights (with no associated pathological changes) were attributed to a stress response, also as a result of the dermal irritation.Therefore these effects are secondary to the local irritant effect of fatty alcohol blend.There were also changes to some clinical chemistry parameters noted (decreased glucose and calcium, increased urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase).The magnitude of change was generally not marked and/or was without pathological correlate in all cases and so they were considered not be adverse.Therefore, as there were no systemic effects noted that could not be attributed to the local irritant response, or were considered to be adverse, the systemic No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level following dermal administration of fatty alcohol blend for a minimum of 90 days was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested).CLINICAL SIGNS AND MORTALITY
Vocalisation (due to pain) was the predominant sign observed in the high dose group (females) generally on one to three days most often during the second week of test article administration. Marked dermal irritation was noted in all dose groups and consisted of very slight to severe erythema, very slight to moderate edema, persistant desquamation, eschar, exfoliation, clear exudate and fissuring. BODY WEIGHT AND WEIGHT GAIN
Group mean body weights were lower than Control during the study for males at 300 mg/kg/day and both sexes at 1000 mg/kg/day by up to 19% at the end of the treatment period.A simialr, but less marked effect on body weight was recorded for both sexes at 100 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day females with group mean body weight up to 6% lower than Control at the end of the treatment period.FOOD CONSUMPTION
Group mean food consumption was slightly lower than Control for males at 1000 mg/kg/day up to Week 9 of the treatment period.Slightly lower group mean food consumption was also noted for females at the same dose during the first week of treatment.No treatment-related effects on litter size or survival were observed.For both males and females food consumption was comparable to Controls thereafter.OPHTHALMOSCOPIC EXAMINATION
No effect of treatment.HAEMATOLOGY
Group mean white blood cell count and neutrophil counts were increased in treated groups compared to Control.The magnitude of the increases was not dose-related.The effect on white cell counts was considered to be attributable to the acute dermal inflammatory response.CLINICAL CHEMISTRY
Group mean albumin was increased and group mean globulin and A/G ratio were decreased in a non dose-related manner in all treatment groups.These changes were considered to be indicative of the acute dermal inflammatory response.A dose-related decrease in group mean glucose levels was noted in all treated groups.Group mean calcium was decreased in 1000 mg/kg/day males and females.Increases in group mean urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferse and/or alanine aminotransferase were also noted at 1000 mg/kg/day.ORGAN WEIGHTS
Group mean absolute and relative adrenal weights were increased in all treated groups.GROSS PATHOLOGY
The only test article related gross lesions observed included scabbing and thickening of the skin at the test site.There were no other test article related gross findings at the scheduled necropsy.HISTOPATHOLOGY: NON-NEOPLASTIC
Squamous cell hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and suppurative inflammation in the skin of the application site was noted in males and females of all treated groups.NOAEL for local effects, based on severe dermal irritation recorded at all doses.Based on the results of the dose-range-finding study discussed, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of the test item Hostacerin DGSB was found to be 1000 mg/kg body weight when administered to the males for two weeks pre-mating, during mating and up to the day before sacrifice during post-mating period (total of 30 days) and to the females for two weeks pre-mating, during mating, pregnancy (gestation) and up to lactation day 13 under the experimental conditions employed in this study.Based on the results form the dose range finding study, dose levels of 0, 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg bw/day are recommended for the main OECD 421 study.No treatment-related effects were observed at 100 ppm dose level and the LOEL, based on decreased food and water consumption and the observation of duodenal mycosal hyperplasia, was 300 ppm.26 and 37 mg/kg bw/day for males and females, respectively; dose-related reductions in food and water consumption were seen at the next higher doses level of 300 ppm; additionally, duodenal mucosal hyperplasia was observed at 300 ppm
NOELNo treatment-related deaths occurred and no treatment-related clinical signs were noted at any time of the study.Male and females exhibited significant reductions in body weight at 3000 ppm.Food and water consumption were significantly reduced at 3000 ppm and notably reduced at 1000 and 300 ppm.Males receiving 3000 ppm displayed significant reductions in total protein and globulin levels in the blood, possibly caused by mucosal hyperplasia occurring in the duodenum of these animals.Necropsy revealed no treatment-related gross lesions.This was reflected in overall motor activity (P<0.05), with some values for the treated males outside of the normally expected ranges for these parameters.Tissue slides indicated an increase in the cross sectional diameter and wall thickness of the duodenum.Subsequent microscopic evaluations revealed mild mucosal hyperplasia in eight of nine males receiving 3000 ppm and in seven of ten males receiving 1000 ppm.Minimal mucosal hyperplasia was noted in one of ten males receiving 300 ppm.Minimal to mild mucosal hyperplasia was also seen in ten of ten females receiving 3000 ppm and in eight of ten females receiving 1000 ppm.No other areas of the gastrointestinal tract were affected.No evidence of cellular atypia or architectual disruptions nor any other indications of neoplastic changes were observed; therefore, the treatment-related mucosal hyperplasia noted was not considered as a neoplastic lesion.No treatment-related effects on body weight were observed in offspring.Body weight gain was slightly decreased in males and females at 160 and 600 mg/kg/day, but there was no dose response. No findings were observed on macroscopic examination of the offspring.The reproductive/developmental LOAEL for Sodium coco β-iminodipropionate in rats is not established. The reproductive/developmental NOAEL is 600 mg/kg bw/day, the highest dose tested, in males and females.Reduced weight gain, adaptive changes to liver and kidneys
NOAELThe No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for adult toxicity, reproduction and offspring survival, growth and development was considered to be 600 mg/kg bw/day.A NOAEL was set at 250 mg/kg/day in females based on statistically significant increase in relative and absolute liver weights and relative kidney weights associated with a statistically significant decrease in bodyweight at 500 mg/kg bw/day.A NOAEL was set at 500 mg/kg bw/day in males based on mortality and statistically significant decreased bodyweight at 1000 mg/kg bw/day.Slight increases in relative liver weights were observed at 250 and 500 mg/kg bw/day but they were not associated with any other toxic effect (bodyweight, hematology, histopathology).CLINICAL SIGNS
- No dose-related clinical findings were noted in animals surviving to the end of study.- Clinical findings in animals that did not survive to the end of the study included thinness, lethargy, and abnormal breathing. MORTALITY
- All 4000 mg/kg bw/day male and female mice died during week 1; 9/10 males and 8/10 females in 2000 mg/kg bw/day group died by week 4


BODY WEIGHT AND WEIGHT GAIN
- Mean body weights of 1000 mg/kg bw/day males and 500 and 2000 mg/kg bw/day females were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls


HAEMATOLOGY & CLINICAL CHEMISTRY: 
- At week 14, an approximately 15-20 % decrease in hematocrit, hemoglobin, and erythrocyte count values occurred in the 1000 mg/kg bw/day male and female mice.However, the erythron effect may be secondary to the decreased body weights.ORGAN WEIGHTS
- Liver: Relative liver weights of 500 and 1000 mg/kg bw/day males and the absolute and relative liver weights of 250 mg/kg bw/day males and 500 and 1000 mg/kg bw/day females were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls 
- Kidney: Absolute and relative right kidney weights of 1000 mg/kg bw/day females, and the relative kidney weights or 250 and 500 mg/kg bw/day females were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls.REPRODUCTIVE PARAMETERS:
- No significant changes seen in the weights neither of the reproductive organs nor in the sperm parameters or estrous cyclicity of the male or female mice at any dose level 


HISTOPATHOLOGY: NON-NEOPLASTIC
- No histopathology changes were observed in mice administered 1000 mg/kg bw/day or less. - Mice in 2000 and 4000 mg/kg bw/day groups were not evaluated due to early deaths.Mortality and statistically significant decreased bodyweight at 1000 mg/kg bw/day.Slight increases in relative liver weights at 250 and 500 mg/kg bw/day not related with any other toxic effect (bodyweight, hematology, histopathology)
NOAELThe oral administration of OH-mPDMS to rats by gavage, at dose levels of 1000, 300 and 100 mg/kg/day, resulted in treatment-related effects at 1000 and 300 mg/kg/day.These effects were considered not to represent an adverse effect of treatment, hence the 'No Observed Adverse Effect Level' (NOAEL) for systemic toxicity was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day.No treatment-related effects were observed at the lowest dose level employed, hence a 'No Observed Effect Level' (NOEL) was established at 100 mg/kg/day.Adult Responses:

MORTALITY:
One female treated with 1000 mg/kg/day was killed in extremis due to difficulties during parturition.There were no further unscheduled deaths during the study.CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS:
No clinically observable signs of toxicity were detected.One female treated with 1000 mg/kg/day showed clinical signs consisting of prostration, hypothermia, pallor of the extremities, pilo-erection and ptosis on Day 41.This animal was in the late stage of gestation and the clinical signs observed would suggest that the animal was experiencing difficulties in parturition.Due to the severity of these observations, this animal was subsequently terminated on Day 41.Remaining clinical signs consisted of increased salivation detected for one male treated with 100 mg/kg/day on Day 23 and swollen limbs were observed for another male treated with 100 mg/kg/day from Day 11 onwards.Generalised fur loss was evident for one female treated with 300 mg/kg/day from Day 39 onwards.This observation was also observed for one control female on Day 43 to Day 45.These findings were isolated in
each case, and were not considered to represent systemic toxicity.FUNCTIONAL OBSERVATIONS:
Behavioural Assessments:
Weekly open field arena observations did not reveal any treatment-related effects for treated animals when compared to controls.All inter and intra group differences in urination, defecation and transfer arousal scores were considered to be a result of normal variation for rats of the strain and age used and were of no toxicological importance.Functional Performance Tests:
A statistically significant increase in the final 20% of overall activity was observed for males treated with 1000 and 300 mg/kg/day (P<0.01).No treatment-related effects were detected in grip strength performance for treated animals when compared to controls.Statistical analysis of the data did not reveal any significant intergroup differences.Sensory Reactivity Assessments:
There were no treatment-related changes in sensory reactivity scores observed for treated animals when compared to controls.All inter and intra group differences in sensory reactivity scores were considered to be a result of normal variation for rats of the strain and age used and were of no toxicological importance.BODYWEIGHT:
No adverse effects on bodyweights change were detected for treated animals when compared to controls.Females treated with 1000 mg/kg/day showed a slightly higher overall bodyweight gain when compared to controls during gestation and lactation, although statistical differences were not observed.Statistically significant intergroup differences were detected for females from all treatment groups in comparison to controls between Days 11 to 15 (P<0.05), although a convincing dose-related response was not observed.Males treated with 1000 and 300 mg/kg/day showed a statistically significant reduction in bodyweight gains when compared to controls between Days 1 to 4 (P<0.01), and the effect was still evident for males treated with 1000 mg/kg/day between Days 4 to 8 (P<0.05).FOOD CONSUMPTION:
No adverse effect on food consumption was detected for males during the treatment period, or for females during the pre-mating, gestation or lactation phases of the study.Food efficiency (the ratio of bodyweight gain to dietary intake) was not affected for males throughout the treatment period, or for females during the pre-mating phase.Females treated with 1000 mg/kg/day showed a statistically significant increase in bilirubin levels when compared to controls during the Day 14 assessments (P<0.05).WATER CONSUMPTION:
No treatment-related intergroup differences in water intake were detected for treated animals when compared to controls.HAEMATOLOGY:
No toxicologically significant effects were detected in the haematological parameters investigated prior to pairing on Day 14 or prior to termination for treated animals when compared to controls.Females treated with 1000 mg/kg/day showed a statistically significant increase in activated partial prothrombin times (APTT) during the Day 14 assessments (P<0.05), with two individual values outside of the normally expected ranges for this parameter.Assessments were therefore repeated on Day 4 post partum.The final assessments did not reveal any significant intergroup differences, therefore, this initial increase in APTT was considered not to represent a true effect of treatment.BLOOD CHEMISTRY:
No toxicologically significant effects were detected in the blood chemical parameters investigated prior to pairing on Day 14 or prior to termination for treated animals when compared to controls.A reduction in blood albumin levels were also evident, but these were observed in the female 300 mg/kg/day dose group only (P<0.05), with two values from this dose group outside of the normally expected range.Blood chemical assessments were therefore repeated prior to termination.Final blood chemical assessments revealed an increase in potassium (P<0.05) and bilirubin (P<0.01) for males treated with 1000 mg/kg/day when compared to controls.All individual values for treated animals were within the normally expected ranges for these parameters, although one control male showed a higher than expected value.Increases in blood sodium and calcium were also observed for females treated with 1000 and 300 mg/kg/day when compared to controls (P<0.05).Increases in sodium levels were also evident for females treated with 100 mg/kg/day (P<0.05) in comparison to controls.All individual values for treated animals were within the normally expected ranges for these parameters, although one control value for both sodium and calcium were lower than the expected ranges.This may have contributed to the statistically significant
increases in the treated groups, which therefore were not considered to represent true effects of treatment.PATHOLOGY(adults):
No treatment-related macroscopic abnormalities were detected.The 1000 mg/kg/day female killed in extremis during parturition, showed pale kidneys and ten dead foetuses in the right uterine horn.Red staining was also recorded around the ano-genital region.Macroscopic abnormalities for terminal kill animals were confined to small seminal vesicles seen for one control group male.Organ Weights:
There were no treatment-related effects detected for organ weights from treated animals when compared to controls.HISTOPATHOLOGY:
Histopathogical examinations revealed the following treatment-related effects:

LUNGS: 
A greater incidence of groups of alveolar macrophages was seen among males treated with 1000 mg/kg/day; alveolar macrophages at this dose level also exhibited foamy/vacuolated cytoplasm in excess of that normally seen as spontaneous change in untreated rats.Alveolar macrophages with foamy cytoplasm or granulomatous appearance were also seen for one female treated with 1000 mg/kg/day and for one male and for two females treated with 300 mg/kg/day.Remaining histopathological changes seen among surviving control and intermediate dose animals were all considered to be spontaneous in origin and unrelated to treatment.The following conditions warrant specific mention:

ADRENAL GLANDS: Cortical vacuolation was seen in a few control and treated male rats and was of no toxicological significance in this investigation.BONE MARROW: Adipose infiltration of the marrow is an indicator of changes in marrow cellularity and in this study there was no difference between control and treated groups.HEART: Focal myocarditis was observed in a few control and treated rats and is a common background lesion in laboratory maintained rats.The severity of the condition was never greater than minimal, or one or two foci, and should not be interpreted as being indicative of any ongoing myocardial disease.KIDNEYS: Globular accumulations of eosinophilic material, as a consequence of excessive accumulation of α2-microglobulin in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, are occasionally encountered as a spontaneous change in male rats.Focal corticomedullary mineralisation is a commonly observed background condition among female rats and was of no toxicological significance in this investigation.LIVER: Scattered mononuclear cell foci were observed in a few control and treated rats examined in the study.Such are commonly observed in the rodent liver and are not indicative of any adverse condition at the severities encountered.LUNGS: A minimal severity of bronchus associated lymphoid tissue was reported for the majority of animals examined in the study and is not indicative of respiratory disease.OESOPHAGUS: Inflammatory cell infiltrates in the peripheral musculature is a commonly observed change that is considered to be related to the physical trauma of gavage dosing.SKELETAL MUSCLE: Mononuclear cell foci are commonly observed in the skeletal muscle of laboratory maintained rats and are of no toxicological significance at the incidences seen in this investigation.SPLEEN: Extramedullary haemopoiesis is a normal background condition in the rat spleen and the severities observed were considered to be within normal limits.THYROID: Follicular cell hypertrophy is commonly seen among untreated rats of either sex and there was no indication of a relationship to treatment in this study.THYMUS: Lymphoid atrophy is frequently seen among pregnant and lactating female rats and there was no evidence of a treatment related group distribution of incidence or severity in this study.REPRODUCTIVE TRACT AND RELATED ORGANS

PITUITARY: No treatment-related changes were seen.TESTIS/EPIDIDYMIS: No treatment-related changes were seen.SEMINAL VESICLES/COAGULATING GLAND: No treatment-related changes were seen.PROSTATE: No pathological changes were seen.This finding was considered to be incidental. MAMMARY GLAND: Glandular hyperplasia was observed in the mammary tissue of the majority of female rats examined.The appearance of the mammary tissue is consistent with pregnancy and lactation.OVARY: No pathological changes were seen.UTERUS: Areas of haemorrhage and fibrosis were seen in the myometrium and adjacent connective tissue of the uterus in the majority of female animals examined from control and high dose groups.These conditions are consistent with normal post partum uterine changes in the rat.VAGINA: No treatment-related changes were seen.All other morphological changes in the above and remaining tissues were those commonly observed in laboratory maintained rats of the age and strain employed and, since there were no differences in incidence or severity between control and treatment groups, all were considered to be without t oxicological significance.No treatment-related effects were observed for reproduction.Based on the results of this ninety day study, the No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) for systemic toxicity of Hydrocarbons, C12-30, olefin-rich, ethylene polymn by product CAS 68911-05-7 was considered to be 1000 mg/kg bw/day.Clinical Observations
- No treatment-related effects
Increased salivation post-dosing on (Days 55 and 56) was observed in 2 females treated with 1000 mg/kg bw/day.This effects was considered related to the oral gavage route and reflect distaste or slight irritancy of the dosing formulations rather than any systemic effect of treatment.Red/brown staining around the snout was observed in only one animal.Body Weight 
- There was no effect of treatment on body weight gain for either sex at dosages of 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day.Overall body weight gain for treated animals was slightly superior to control and the occasional statistically significant differences in body weight gain for treated animals were considered to reflect normal biological variation and were unrelated to treatment.Food Consumption
- There was no effect of treatment on food consumption for either sex at 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day.Water Consumption 
- There was no observed effect of treatment on water consumption for either sex at dosages of 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day. Ophthalmoscopic Examination
-Ophthalmic examination of the eyes from rats receiving 1000 mg/kg bw/day did not indicate any effect of treatment. Functional Observations 
-Behavioral Assessments:
Weekly assessment of the animals in a standard arena did not reveal any obvious adverse effects of treatment at dosages of 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day.Functional Performance Tests:
Assessment of functional performance using grip strength and motor activity did not indicate any obvious effects of treatment for either at dosages of 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day.Sensory Reactivity Assessments:
There were no differences observed in the scores for sensory reactivity for either sex during the study.Haematological findings
- For males at 1000 mg/kg bw/day, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration was statistically significantly lower than control.All of the individual values were within historical control range and in the absence of any associated changes the intergroup difference was considered of no toxicological significance.For females at 1000 mg/kg bw/day, erythrocyte count was statistically significantly lower than control; however only two individual values for these treated animals was below the historical control range.In the absence of any associated changes the intergroup difference was considered of no toxicological significance.For females at 100 mg/kg bw/day, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration was statistically significantly lower than control.All of the individual values were within historical control range and in the absence of a true dose related response, the intergroup difference was considered of no toxicological significance.Blood Chemistry 
- There was considered to be no effect of treatment on blood chemistry parameters for either sex at 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day.
 For males at 1000 mg/kg bw/day, lower albumin, total protein and albumin/globulin ratio attained statistical significance when compared with control.The majority of individual values were within the historical control range and in the absence of any histopathological correlates, the intergroup differences were considered to be incidental and unrelated to treatment.
 Pathology and Histopathology
- Neither the type, incidence nor distribution of findings observed at terminal necropsy and during microscopic examination of the tissues from animals that received 1000 mg/kg bw/day indicated any effect of treatment.Organ Weights 
- There was considered to be no effect of treatment on the organ weights measured for either sex at 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day.At all dosages, absolute and body weight relative ovary weights were statistically significantly lower than control.All of the individual values were within historical control range and in the absence of a true dose related response or any histopathological correlates, the intergroup differences were considered of no toxicological significance.No significant effects seen at 1000 mg/kg/day
NOELThe ‘No Observed Effect Level’ (NOEL) for systemic toxicity was considered to be 300 mg/kg bw/day, based on irritation in the forestomach at 1000 mg/kg/day.The NOAEL was however considered to be 1000 mg/kg bw/day because the findings were not evidence of true systemic toxicity.The ‘No Observed Effect Level’ (NOEL) for reproductive toxicity was considered to be 1000 mg/kg bw/day.The findings were not considered to reflect true systemic toxicity
NOAELThe NOAEC for both male and female rats (adults and offspring) was 3000 ppm (10560 mg/m3).In all cases, fat absorption by animals fed PGE at the 5 and 10% dietary levels was significantly less than corresponding SBO control values.The LOAEC for these groups was 9000 ppm based on reduced body weight.There were no adverse effects to reproduction, therefore the NOAEC for reproduction is 9000 ppm (31680 mg/m3).reduced body weight
LOAECUnder the conditions of an OECD 422 compliant study, the test item administered at 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg bw/day (corrected doses; corresponding to uncorrected doses of 110.46, 331.38 and 1104.61 mg/kg bw/day, respectively) by oral gavage did not cause signs of systemic toxicity and did not adversely influence the reproductive performance (gonad function, mating behavior, conception, parturition) in parental male and female Han:WIST rats.The development of the F1 offspring was not impaired from birth to post-natal day 13 at any dose level after repeated oral administration of dams.Based on these observations the No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAEL) were determined as follows:
NOAEL for systemic toxicity of male/female rats: 1000 mg/kg bw/day
NOAEL for reproductive performance of male/ female rats: 1000 mg/kg bw/day
NOAEL for F1 Offspring: 1000 mg/kg bw/day


NOAELIn order to generate preliminary information on the possible health hazards likely to arise from repeated exposure over a relatively limited period of time, Fatty acids, tall-oil, epoxidized,2-ethylhexylesters (ETP) was administered orally by gavage at dosages of 0 (corn oil), 100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg body weight/day to male rats for 28 days and to female rats throughout the pre-pairing, pairing and gestation periods until the individual day 4 post partum. Administration of 1000 mg/kg/day resulted in increased liver weights (males and females) and minimal hepatocellular hypertrophy (males and females), that were considered to represent an adaptive change most likely induced by an increased biotransformation of the test item.Therefore, it was considered not to be adverse.Administration of 300 mg/kgbw/day resulted in increased liver weights (males and females).In the absence of any histopathological correlate, these increased weights were considered not to be adverse.Based in these data, the NOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg bw/day.In the absence of any adverse effects on reproductive parameters, the NOAEL and NOEL for reproduction/developmental toxicity were considered to be
 1000 mg/kg bw/day.Absorption in animals fed the lowest level of the test material (2.5 %) was also less than that observed in the soybean oil-fed controls, but the differences were not uniformly significant.The only effect noted at this concentration was an increased liver weight
NOAELPolyglycerol ester (deca-glycerol deca-oleate) was fed to rats at dietary levels of 2.5, 5.0, and 10 % for 90 days.All animals appeared to be in excellent health throughout the study, and no adverse effects were found
upon survival, growth, organ weights, organ : body weight ratios, and hematologic values.There were no significant gross or microscopic tissue changesw hich could be attributed to dietary treatment.Total fat absorption, as measured by fecal fatty acids, decreasedin a dose-related response.Eight males and six females treated with 100 mg/kg bw/day also showed incidences of increased salivation from Day 44 (Females) and Day 45 (Males).This resulted in a decreased utilization of feed by males fed PGE at the 10 % dietary level.These data show that absorption of
PGE was not complete. Excretion of nitrogen in the urine by females fed PGE at the 10% dietary level was significantly greater than the control value during both the third and ninth collection periods.The reason for this difference is not understood
at the time of this study.It may be seen that the percentage of dietary fatty acids absorbed decreased as the level of PGE in the diet was increased.Values from animals in the group fed free oleic acid and glycerol fell between those of the 5 % PGE and SBO control groups.Gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) analyses of fecal fatty acids showed that excretion of oleic acid increased in a dose-related fashion : the oleic acid content of fecal fatty acids from animals fed the SBO control diet was 23 % compared to 32,41, and 51% when PGE was fed at levels of 2.5, 5.0, and lo%, respectively.It should be remembered that oleic acid (C,,l=) was the major fatty acid constituent (56 %) of the PGE product (Table 1).The increased excretion of fatty acids in general, and oleic acid in particular, shows that absorption of dietary PGE was not complete.Observations of this nature are commonly experienced following the oral administration of an unpalatable or slightly irritant test item formulation and in isolation are considered not to be of toxicological importance.The fecal oleic acid may have resulted from the excretion of intact PGE or from hydrolyzed or partially hydrolyzed but unabsorbed material.The oleic acid content of fecal fatty acids from animals fed free oleic and glycerol was 41x, corresponding exactly to the 5 % PGE group.decreased total fat absorption at 5 and 10%
NOELThe oral administration of AS1100 to rats by gavage for a period of 90 consecutive days at dose levels of 10, 100 and 300 mg/kg bw/day resulted in treatment related effects in animals of either sex at 300 mg/kg bw/day and in males at 100 mg/kg bw/day.The No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) was considered to be 10 mg/kg bw/day for males and 100 mg/kg bw/day for females. Lower body weight gains in males treated with 300 mg/kg bw/day were considered insufficient in magnitude to represent an adverse effect of treatment.The increased liver weights in animals of either sex treated with 300 mg/kg bw/day and in males treated with 100 mg/kg bw/day, accompanied by associated increases in hepatic enzymes, in the absence of microscopic changes in the liver do not represent an adverse effect of treatment.The effects were considered to represent an adaptive response to treatment and therefore considered not to represent a serious risk to health. For this reason, 300 mg/kg bw/day may be regarded as a 'No Observed Adverse Effect Level' (NOAEL) for animals of either sex.Mortality
There were no unscheduled deaths.Clinical Observations
Neither the type, incidence or distribution of clinical signs apparent indicated an adverse effect of treatment at 10, 100 or 300 mg/kg bw/day.Animals of either sex treated with 300 mg/kg bw/day had increased salivation post-dose from Day 22 (Females) and Day 23 (Males).No such effects were detected in animals of either sex treated with 10 mg/kg bw/day.Functional Observations
Behavioral Assessments
There were no treatment-related changes in the behavioural parameters measured.All inter and intra group differences in urination and defecation were considered to be a result of normal variation for rats of the strain and age used, and the differences were of no toxicological importance.Functional Performance Tests
There were no toxicologically significant changes in functional performance.Males treated with 10 mg/kg bw/day had a statsitically significant reduction in overall activity.No dose relationship was apparent and in the absence of any associated supporting clinical observations to suggest a neurotoxic effect of treatment, this intergroup difference was considered not to be toxicologically significant. Females treated with 100 mg/kg bw/day had a statistically significant reduction in overall mobility.No dose relationship was evident, therefore the intergroup differences were considered to represent normal biological variation rather than an effect of treatment. Sensory Reactivity Assessments
There were no treatment-related changes in sensory reactivity.All inter and intra group differences in sensory reactivity scores were considered to be a result of normal variation for rats of the strain and age used and were of no toxicological importance. Body Weight
Overall body weight gain was lower than control for males at 300 mg/kg bw/day.Group mean body weight gains were generally lower than control throughout the treatment period with differences from control attaining statistical significance during Weeks 7, 10 and 11.Whilst an effect of treatment on body weight development was apparent in males at this dose level, the magnitude of the effect observed was considered insufficient in severity to consider the effect adverse. No effects of treatment on body weight development were apparent for females treated with 300 mg/kg bw/day or animals of either sex treated with 10 or 100 mg/kg bw/day.Three renal function tests (plasma Cr and urea levels and CL_Cr) showed that injection of 5 mg/kg of single-dose CP in this animal model, led to significant deterioration of kidney function in "Air+CP" group after three days in comparison to "Air+Saline" group (P < 0.005).
In addition, oxygen administration per se (in its highest dose, i.e. six hours per day for seven days) had no effect on renal function and there were no significant differences between "Air+Saline" and "O_2+ Saline" groups in above mentioned renal function tests.
Administration of single-dose O_2 to group 3 (6hO2 48hLCP) for six hours led to considerable and significant reduction in both blood urea and Cr levels in this group in comparison with ‚ÄúAir + CP‚Äù (P < 0.005) but it showed no significant differences with ‚ÄúAir + Saline‚Äù and ‚ÄúO_2+Saline‚Äù groups.
The difference in CL_Cr was insignificant between ‚Äú6hO2 48hLCP‚Äù and ‚ÄúAir + CP‚Äù groups (P = 0.089); moreover, there was no significant differences between group 3 and any of groups 1 and 2 (P = 0.18 and P = 0.47, respectively).
Seven days of six hours per day administration of O_2 had no significant effect on any of renal function tests if CP was injected 48 hours or 72 hours after last session of O_2 administration (no differences between groups 4 or 5 and group 7).
Some degree of renal function amelioration was seen if CP was administrated seven days after this protocol of O_2 administration (significant or marginally significant reduction in plasma urea and Cr levels, respectively, in comparison with group 7,).
CL_Cr in ‚Äú7dayO2 7dayLCP‚Äù group was not significantly different from ‚ÄúAir + CP‚Äù group but it was significantly and marginally significantly less than group 1 (P = 0.015) and group 2, respectively (P = 0.063).
There was an insignificant deterioration of all these three renal function indicators in groups 4 and 5 in comparison to the control group (Figure 1).
In comparison with control group, the changes pattern of all FE_Na levels in the first six groups was similar to the changes in plasma urea and Cr levels, but none of the differences were significant except that of group 4, which had a significantly higher FE_Na level than control group (Figure 1).
The results of cleaved Capase-3 gene translation and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (as markers of renal cell apoptosis) by Western Blot Analysis were almost precisely in parallel with renal function tests, especially plasma urea and Cr levels.
In other words, significant elevation of these markers of apoptosis by CP administration without O_2 pretreatment (in group 7 in comparison with groups 1 and 2) and significant reduction of both of these markers in groups 3 and 6, but not in groups 4 and 5 was detected (Figure 2).
Subcapsular, cortical, and subcortical necrosis scores were significantly elevated by CP administration in group 7 in comparison with groups 1 and 2.
There was also considerable and significant reduction of subcapsular and cortical necrosis scores in ‚Äú6hO2 48hLCP‚Äù in comparison to control group.
The reduction in subcortical necrosis score was insignificant (P = 0.1).
All three necrosis scores in group 6 were smaller than control group but the differences were insignificant.
Except a significant reduction in cortical necrosis of group 4, similar to renal function tests, there were no significant differences between groups 4 or 5 in comparison with control group and even significant worsening of the subcortical necrosis in group 5 was seen.
The karyomegaly percentage was significantly higher in group 5 in comparison to all other groups and there was not any significant difference between any of other groups (Figures 3, 4 and 5).
Catalase, GPx, and SOD enzymes activity levels and TBARS content are shown in Table 1.
The differences between any of antioxidant enzyme levels were not significant.
The content of TBARS was significantly different between groups by employing one-way ANOVA. (Between groups statistical analysis are shown in Table 1).
Effect of acrylamide pretreatment on the body weight changes The changes of body weight were measured daily during the course of acrylamide pretreatment.
As shown in Figure 1, compared with normal saline-treated mice, oral administration of acrylamide (20 and 30 mg/kg/day) caused a decrease in body weight of mice during 21 days of pretreatment.
Effect of acrylamide on total DAI score, length of colon, and mortality rate in colitis After induction of colitis in mice the clinical signs of colitis were determined by assessing DAI (Figure 2A).
Compared with the normal mice, the total DAI score of all colitis groups was considerably increased.
However in both groups pretreated with acrylamide, DAI as an indicator of the severity of colitis was higher than that in control mice.
Acrylamide at the dose of 30 mg/kg was more effective than that at the dose of 20 mg/kg.
Shortening of colon length is considered an indicator of colonic inflammation and damage.
Intrarectal use of acetic acid reduced the length of colon in the control group (Figure 2B).
The colon length in mice pretreated with acrylamide was shorter than that in the control mice.
As shown in Figure 2C, administration of acetic acid in the control group resulted in mortality rate of 10 % while induction of colitis in mice exposed to acrylamide (20 and 30 mg/kg/day) caused a higher rate of mortality (30% and 50%, respectively).
Effect of acrylamide on the macroscopic appearance in colitis The colonic mucosa in saline-treated mice was normal without any damage (Figure 3A).
Administration of acetic acid into the colon of mice produced mucosal injury as revealed by edema, hyperemia, slight bleeding, and small mucosal erosions.
These changes in the colonic mucosa confirmed the induction of ulcerative colitis and resulted in increase in mean macroscopic score as compared with normal mice.
These morphological changes in the colonic mucosa and macroscopic scores in mice exposed to acrylamide were higher than those in control mice (Figures 3A and B).
These data indicate that acrylamide was able to increase the susceptibility of colonic mucosa to acetic acid-induced colitis.
Effect of acrylamide on pathological changes in colitis Histopathological analysis of colon tissue in saline treated mice exposed intact epithelium with no histological abnormalities (Figure 4A).
In contrast, in control colitis mice intrarectal use of acetic acid produced an inflammatory reaction characterized by submucosal edema, leukocyte infiltration, epithelial damage, and loss of goblet cells.
These histopathological alterations of colon mucosa in mice treated with acrylamide were significantly intensified.
As shown in Figure 4B the histopathological score was also increased in both acrylamide groups as compared with the control colitis mice.
Aggravating effect of acrylamide on the histological features of colon at dose of 30 mg/kg was significantly higher than that at dose of 20 mg/kg.
Effect of acrylamide onMDA, protein carbonyl,SOD, GSH, and catalase levels MDA and carbonyl protein levels of colon tissue were evaluated as biochemical index of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation.
As shown in Figures 5A and B, after the induction of colitis, MDA and protein carbonyl levels were increased.
The elevation of MDA and carbonyl protein in colon tissue of mice exposed to acrylamide was significantly increased as compared with the control group.
Acetic acid-induced oxidative stress in colon tissue leads to the depletion of SOD, GSH, and catalase as endogenous anti-oxidants (Figures 5C, D, and E).
The reduction of SOD, GSH, and catalase was significantly intensified in both acrylamide groups (20 and 30 mg/kg/day) as compared with those in the control mice.
The effect of acrylamide on the biomarkers MDA, SOD, GSH, and catalase was dose dependent.
Therefore, chronic acrylamide exposure impairs the anti-oxidant capacity of the colon during colitis.
Effect of acrylamide onthe level of NO and the expression of iNOS As shown in Figures 6A and B, acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis increased iNOS expression and the production of NO in colon tissue.
Compared with the control group, chronic pretreatment of mice with acrylamide caused a further increase in iNOS expression and subsequently NO production in colon tissue during colitis.
Effect of acrylamide onMPO, MMP-9, and MCP-1 levels Experimental colitis increased the activity of MPO and the levels of MCP-1 and MMP-9 as markers of inflammatory damage in the colonic tissue (Figure 7).
The elevation in the colonic contents of MPO, MMP-9, and MCP-1 was intensified in mice exposed to acrylamide as compared with the control colitis mice.
The effect of acrylamide on the levels of MPO, MMP-9, and MCP-1 at the dose of 30 mg/kg was higher than that at dose of 20 mg/kg.
This result indicates that chronic acrylamide exposure could stimulate colitis-induced immune cell infiltration and colonic epithelium destruction.
Moreover, this result was consistent with the histopathological findings.
Effect of acrylamide onthe level of cytochrome-c and caspase-3 As shown in Figure 8, induction of colitis increased the levels of cytochrome-c and caspase-3 as makers of apoptosis in colon tissues of colitic mice when compared with the normal saline-treated mice.
The elevation in the colonic level of cytochrome-c and caspase-3 was dose-dependently increased in mice pretreated with acrylamide (20 and 30 mg/kg) as compared with the control colitis mice.
Effect of acrylamide on NF-Œ∫B expression and the inflammatory cytokines Evaluation of NF-Œ∫B gene expression in the experimental groups revealed that induction of colitis increased the expression of NF-Œ∫B in all colitis mice (Figure 9).
However, this increase in acrylamide groups (20 and 30 mg/kg/day) was significantly higher than that in the control mice.
As shown in Figure 10, the proinflammatory cytokine levels of IL-1Œ≤, TNF-Œ±, IL-6, and IFN-Œ≥ were increased whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was decreased in colitis mice.
The changes of these cytokines were significantly intensified in both acrylamide groups as compared with the control mice.
The effect of acrylamide on the NF-Œ∫B expression and the production of TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, and IFN-Œ≥ at dose of 30 mg/kg was greater than that at dose of 20 mg/kg.
These results propose that chronic acrylamide exposure is able to promote colitis-induced inflammation through the NF-Œ∫B pathway and associated production of proinflammatory cytokines in colon tissue.
There were no abnormal signs of toxicity or death recorded after the eight weeks of treatment at the dose range of 10-1000 mg/kg body weight.
Body weight gradually increased at these doses comparable with that of control (Table 1).
The activity of aspartate amino transferase (AST), showed no significant change in all dose levels studied.
At doses of 10 or 100 mg/kg body weight compared to the control, there was also no significant change in the activity of ALT.
However, a significant increase was observed at the dose of 1000 mg/kg (Table 1).
The activity of plasma ALP increased at doses of 100 and 1000 mg/kg, but no significant difference was observed at lower doses of 10 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg.
BUN level at the dose of 1000 mg/kg was significantly higher than in the control; however there was no significant difference at the doses of 10 and 1000 mg/kg compared to the control.
There was no significant difference in the values of TP and ALB at all dose levels studied (Table 1).
There were no significant differences in the erythrocytic parameters.
PCV was not affected by all the dose levels studied.
There was also no significant difference in haemoglobin concentration, RBC and MCV at all dose levels.
There was however significant differences in WBC values at doses of 100 and 1000 mg/kg compared to that of 10 mg/kg and control.
In the differential leukocyte count, neutrophils showed significant difference at the dose levels of 100 and 1000 mg/kg compared to the values at the dose of 10 mg/kg and control, while lymphocyte, monocyte and eosinophil counts showed no significant difference at all dose levels compared to control (Table 2).
There were no overt pathological lesions at lower dose levels studied.
However, at doses ‚â• 1000 mg/kg, histopathological changes including inflammation and necrosis were observed in both kidney and liver tissues (Figures 1 and 2).
No deaths were observed in phase 1 and 2 of the acute toxicity evaluation of EEXA (Table I).
The phytochemical screening of EEXA showed high concentrations of alkaloids, saponins, and tannins and moderate concentrations of flavonoids, steroids, and cardiac glycosides (Table I).
The administration of 200-800mg/kg of EEXA for 15 and 30 days did not produce significant (p > 0.05) effects on body, testicular, epididymis, and prostate weights when compared to the control group.
However, significant increase in the body weight (p = 0.03) with significant decreases in testicular (p = 0.01), epididymis (p = 0.01), and prostate (p = 0.02) weights were observed in rats administered with 800 mg/kg of EEXA for 60 days when compared to the control group (Table II).
Furthermore, dose and time-dependent decreases in sperm count, motility, normal morphology, volume, and viability were observed in rats administered with 200-800 mg/kg of EEXA for 15, 30, and 60 days when compared to the control group (Tables III-IV).
Significant decreases in sperm viability (p = 0.02), volume (p = 0.03), normal morphology (p = 0.02), sperm count (p = 0.02), and motility (p = 0.03) were observed in rats administered with 400mg/kg of EEXA for 30 days when compared to the control group (Table III).
However, significant decreases in normal morphology (p = 0.001), sperm count (p = 0.001), and motility (p = 0.001) were observed after 60 days of the administration of 800 mg/kg of EEXA when compared to the control group (Table III).
In contrast, treatment with EEXA did not produce significant effect on sperm pH when compared to the control group (p = 0.09) (Table IV).
Furthermore, this study observed significant increases in serum prolactin, progesterone and estradiol hormones with significant decreases in serum testosterone, luteinizing, and follicle stimulating hormones in a dose and time-dependent fashion after the administration of 200 and 400 mg/kg of EEXA for 15, 30, and 60 days respectively when compared to the control group (Tables IV and V).
Significant (p < 0.001) increases in serum prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone levels with significant decreases in serum testosterone, luteinizing, and follicle stimulating hormones were observed in rats administered with 800 mg/kg of EEXA for 60 days when compared to the control group (Tables IV and V).
The LD_50 of Av was equal to 3000 mg/kg body weight, so 5%, 10% and 20% of the LD_50 of Av seed extract equal to 150, 300 and 600 mg/kg, respectively.
Av seed extract administrated at doses 150, 300 and 600 mg/kg bw/d respectively by oral gavage into normal male and female rats did not induce any death or toxic symptoms in treated rats.
All animals were normal throughout the study and survived until the end of the 14-day experiment period.
No mortality and clinical changes were observed in both males and females during the test.
Both male and female animals did not reveal any disturbance in animal behavior or other physiological activities.
No difference in food consumption and water intake were found between control and treated rats throughout the period of 28 day.
Slight changes were observed in animal body and organs weights in all the Av-treated animals in comparison with control rats after 28 successive days of Av oral intake.
It was obvious that Av seed extract did not induce any change in Hb, Hct, RBCs, WBCs, serum glucose and total cholesterol in all the treated animals compared to control group after 28 days of study period (see Table 1).
It was clear that Av seed extract did not induce any change in serum AST, ALT, ALP, total bilirubin, total protein and albumin in all the treated animals compared to control group after 28 days of study period (see Table 2).
It was observable that Av seed extract did not induce any change in serum urea, creatinine and uric acid, as well as, tissue serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in all the treated animals compared to control group after 28 days of study period (see Table 3).
It is clear that Av seed extract did not induce any change in serum Ts, DHEA-SO_4, 3Œ≤HSD, 17Œ≤-E and E-17Œ≤-s activities on treated male and female animals compared to control group after 28 days of study period (see Table 4).
Histological structure of the liver in all treated rats was comparable with normal pattern of the organ in controls (Figure 1A).
No changes of hepatic lobular architecture and hepatocytes were observed (Figures 1B, C&D).
Histological structure of the kidney in all treated rats was comparable with normal pattern of the organ in controls (Figure 2A).
No changes of glomeruli and the renal tubules architecture were detected (Figures 2B, C&D).
Histological structure of the brain in all treated rats was comparable with normal pattern of the organ in controls (Figure 3A).
No changes of the normal brain structure architecture were identified (Figures 3B, C&D).
Histological structure of the spleen in all treated rats was comparable with normal pattern of the organ in controls (Figure 4A).
No changes within macrophages in the red pulp with normal structure architecture were found (Figures 4B, C&D).
Histological structure of the heart in all treated rats was comparable with normal pattern of the organ in controls (Figure 5A).
No changes in cardiac muscle fibers, acidophilic cytoplasm and centrally located nuclei were observed (Figures 5B, C&D).
Histological structure of the testis in all treated rats was comparable with normal pattern of the organ in controls (Figure 6A).
No changes in seminiferous tubules and germ cells architecture were identified (Figures 6B, C&D).
Histological structure of the ovary in all treated rats was comparable with normal pattern of the organ in controls (Figure 7A).
No changes in small follicles and large follicles architecture were reported (Figures 7B, C&D).
The animals showed significant signs of toxicity after the administration of Kafura at dose level of 1000 mg/kg as shown in Table 1A and Table 1B. Breathing abnormalities and slow movement of the treated mice were seen, convulsion and mortality were recorded at this dose.
LD_50 was calculated to be 316.23 mg/kg.
The body-weight gain and the brain weight of the experimental animals in control and Kafura-treated group are shown in Figures 1 and 2A respectively.
There was a decrease in the percentage body weight gain in the animals treated with Kafura (237 mg/kg), but not statistically different, compared to control.
The brain weight of the Kafura-treated rats was noted to have increased slightly when compared to control.
The water maze test showed a statistically significant increase in escape latency (seconds) in kafura-treated rats, compared to control and across treated groups (Figure 2B).
The effects of oral administration of kafura on the haematological parameters are shown (Table 2).
The levels of RBC, HGB, HCT, Lymphocytes, MID (Indicates the combined value of the other types of white blood cells not classified as lymphocytes or granulocytes), and percentage Granulocyte, showed a statistically significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the kafura-treated groups, compared to control.
